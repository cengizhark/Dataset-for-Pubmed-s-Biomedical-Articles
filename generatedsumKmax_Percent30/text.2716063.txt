As shown in Fig. We therefore sought to explore the role of GSK3β in PDGF-mediated neuroprotection. In the present study, we next sought to examine whether PDGF-BB could phosphorylate and thus, inactivate Bad in SH-SY5Y cells. 3B PDGF-BB treatment resulted in inactivation of Bad with its coupling to protein 14-3-3. To gain insights into the role of these complementary proteins, we examined time-dependent expression of these proteins in SH-SY5Y cells treated with PDGF-BB and/or gp120.

The current thinking about the model of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis is thus that indirect consequences of virus-infected mononuclear phagocytes lead to neuronal degeneration (Nath, 1999). Role of PI3K/Akt pathway in cell survival has also been demonstrated in protection by other growth factors as well (Hashimoto et al , 2002; Almeida et al , 2005; Langford et al , 2005). Some of the factors, such as fibroblast growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have been shown to protect neurons by down-modulating the expression of the coreceptor CXCR4, activating cell-survival signals, and inhibiting the internalization of HIV-1 coded proteins (Sanders et al , 2000; Bachis et al , 2003). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway results in phosphorylation of the downstream GSK-3β, a physiologically relevant principal regulatory target of the Akt pathway (Facci et al , 2003).

Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway results in phosphorylation of the downstream GSK-3β, a physiologically relevant principal regulatory target of the Akt pathway (Facci et al , 2003). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β often leads to its inactivation, which consequently results in nuclear translocation of key downstream transcription factors such as β-catenin and NF-κβ (Romashkova & Makarov, 1999; Fang et al , 2007). In the present study we found that PDGF treatment of SH-SY5Y cells resulted in time-dependent phosphorylation of Bad that could be blocked by PI3K inhibitor. We have clearly shown that in the presence of gp120, there was increased expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax, while the levels of Bcl-xL remained unaffected resulting in increased Bax to Bcl-xL ratio, thus exemplifying apoptosis. It is suggested that in response to death stimuli, mitochondrial membranes are permeabilized (Newmeyer et al , 1994; Kroemer, 1999), thereby causing the release of cytochrome C (Kluck et al , 1997; Green & Reed, 1998).

This technique has been successfully used to assess the functional status of mitochondria in cultured neurons (White & Reynolds, 1996). Based on our current findings we suggest a potential survival cascade that is initiated by PDGF/PDGF-R axis in gp120-exposed neurons. It has been reported that the phosphorylation of Bad at either Ser-112 or Ser-136 facilitates formation of a complex between Bad and 14-3-3 in the cytosol, blocking its interaction with Bcl-xL at the mitochondrial level (Datta et al , 1997).

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated dementia (HAD) is a severe form of neurological impairment found in almost 20–30% of HIV-1 infected patients in the late stages of AIDS (Kolson & Gonzalez-Scarano, 2000).

Our findings suggest the roles of both PI3K/Akt and Bcl family pathways in PDGF-mediated neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y cells. Our findings suggest the roles of both PI3K/Akt and Bcl family pathways in PDGF-mediated neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y cells. MaterialsHuman recombinant PDGF-BB was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and viral gp120 (IIIB strain) was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of National Institutes of Health. In the experiments involving pharmacological inhibitors, cells were pre-cultured with the corresponding inhibitor(s) for 1h prior to treatment with gp120 &/or PDGF-BB. Cell purity was determined by immunocytochemistry using anti-MAP-2 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and were found to be >95% pure. Western blots were performed using the appropriate dilution of primary antibodies against the corresponding antigen (1:500 phospho-Akt, 1:200 phospho-PDGFβR, 1:200 phospho-GSK, 1:200 Bcl-xL, 1:200 Bax (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); 1:200 phospho-Bad ser136 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); 1:500 NF-κB (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); and 1:4000 β-actin (Sigma). Following the respective treatments, 50μl of medium was removed to a new multi-well plate to evaluate the LDH released into the medium. Each experiment consisted of three replicates and was repeated at least three times. Isolation of Cytochrome C and Cytochrome C ELISA AssayThe isolation of cytochrome C in the cytosolic fraction was performed using the Mitochondrial Fractionation Kit (Acive motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Cell supernatants were re-centrifuged at 11,000g for 20 min twice and the supernatant fractions were stored at −80°C for cytochrome C ELISA using the FunctionELISA™ Cytochrome C kit (Acive motif). Briefly, 100μl samples were diluted to 50μg/ml in blocking buffer and were added to each well followed by incubation for 2hrs at room temperature.

One hundred microliter of HRP-conjugated streptavidin was them added following the removal of the detecting antibody and incubation continued for 1 hour. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Student t test. Since binding of PDGF-BB to its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor results in receptor phosphorylation, we first wanted to investigate the kinetics of this process.
