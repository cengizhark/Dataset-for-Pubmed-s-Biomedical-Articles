This raises the intriguing possibility that nanoparticles could enter the circulation and produce direct or indirect effects on blood cells, such as monocytes or neutrophils. Exposure of U937 cells to either Nano-Ni or Nano-TiO2 did not cause any change in TIMP-2 mRNA expression (data not shown). There was also a time-dependent increase in HIF-1α accumulation in U937 cells exposed to 30 μg/ml of Nano-Ni (Figure 9). Recent studies in humans showed that exposure to nano-sized carbon altered peripheral blood leukocyte distribution and expression of adhesion molecules (Frampton et al  2006). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play an active role in regulating the extracellular matrix (Murphy et al  1994; Parks and Shapiro 2001; Parks 2003; Greenlee et al  2007). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play an active role in regulating the extracellular matrix (Murphy et al  1994; Parks and Shapiro 2001; Parks 2003; Greenlee et al  2007). Choosing the doses that are lower than the cytotoxic dose can help to identify potential toxic effects of nanoparticles that are not due to cytotoxicity (Mo et al  2009). Though TIMPs are believed the inhibitors of MMPs, the activation of TIMP-1 is not always strictly related to its function as a MMP inhibitor (Cammarota et al  2006). HIF-1α is produced or activated in response to hypoxia (Wang and Semenza 1993a, 1993b, Wang et al  1995; Yamashita et al  2001), whereas HIF-1β protein is constitutively present regardless of oxygen tension (Liu et al  2007). HIF-1α is produced or activated in response to hypoxia (Wang and Semenza 1993a, 1993b, Wang et al  1995; Yamashita et al  2001), whereas HIF-1β protein is constitutively present regardless of oxygen tension (Liu et al  2007). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have clearly shown that exposure to nickel caused HIF-1α accumulation (Salnikow et al  2002, 2003; Davidson et al  2003; Zhao et al  2004). The results suggest that HIF-1α may be involved not only in the regulation of MMPs, but also in the regulation of TIMP-1, which is consistent with previous studies (Haorah et al  2007; Ho et al  2007; Shi et al  2007). These data provide valuable clues to the potential health effects of metal nanoparticle exposure. It is well known that regulation of MMPs may occur at multiple levels, either by gene transcription and synthesis of inactive pro-enzymes, post-translational activation of pro-enzymes, or via the interaction of secreted MMPs with their inhibitors called tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Murphy et al  1994; Parsons et al  1997; Oum’hamed et al  2004). However, few studies have investigated the effects of nickel nanoparticles on alteration of MMPs/TIMPs expression or activities and the potential mechanisms involved in these effects. Nickel is known to mimic hypoxia through activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (Salnikow et al  2002; Maxwell and Salnikow 2004). Nickel is known to mimic hypoxia through activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (Salnikow et al  2002; Maxwell and Salnikow 2004). Upon dimerization with another subunit of HIF, HIF-1β, HIF-1 binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in target genes, such as VEGF and MMPs, and activates them (Salnikow et al  2002; Maxwell and Salnikow 2004). Upon dimerization with another subunit of HIF, HIF-1β, HIF-1 binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in target genes, such as VEGF and MMPs, and activates them (Salnikow et al  2002; Maxwell and Salnikow 2004). Upon dimerization with another subunit of HIF, HIF-1β, HIF-1 binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in target genes, such as VEGF and MMPs, and activates them (Salnikow et al  2002; Maxwell and Salnikow 2004). Several studies have shown that exposure to hypoxic stress resulted in MMPs modulation through activation of HIF-1α (Milkiewicz and Haas 2005; Fujiwara et al  2007; Misra et al  2008). Similar to hypoxia, disruption of prolyl hydroxylase activity has been shown to be one of the mechanisms for Ni-induced HIF-1α stabilization (Salnikow et al  2002, 2003; Davidson et al  2003). The microstructure and composition of Nano-Ni and Nano-TiO2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitach H-8000) and ancillary techniques including selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive (X-ray) spectrometry (EDS). Briefly, the specific surface area is 43.8 m2/g for Nano-Ni and 45.0 m2/g for Nano-TiO2. After shaking for 48 h in a water bath at 37° C, the samples were ultrasonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. Chemicals and reagentsMonoclonal mouse anti-human HIF-1α antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) unless otherwise indicated. All chemicals used were of analytic grade. U937 cells were exposed to Nano-Ni or Nano-TiO2 at the doses and times indicated in each experiment. MTS assay is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium compound (MTS) into a formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. Then cells were treated with various concentrations of Nano-Ni or Nano-TiO2 for 24 h. 20 μl of the combined MTS/PMS (phenazine methosulfate) solution was added to each well of the plate. In order to eliminate the potential effects of metal nanoparticles on optical properties, medium with metal nanoparticles at each dose, but without cells were used as background and their A490 readings were subtracted from the experimental groups.
