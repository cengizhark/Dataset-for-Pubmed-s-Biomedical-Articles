Western-diet feeding also increases the patrolling behavior of Ly6Clo monocytes along the vascular endothelium in a CD36− and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)-dependent manner [95].

Foam cells contribute to the mass of the atherosclerotic plaque and are directly implicated in the development of the necrotic core, a hallmark of plaques vulnerable to rupture [97]. Foam cells contribute to the mass of the atherosclerotic plaque and are directly implicated in the development of the necrotic core, a hallmark of plaques vulnerable to rupture [97]. Canakinumab produces a 15% decrease in the primary composite endpoint (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD death) compared to placebo-treated individuals, which is accompanied by 60% reductions in C-Reactive Protein, a risk factor for future CVD events [116]. Conversely, the initiation of atherosclerotic plaque formation that frequently underlies CVD is characterized by deposition of lipoproteins within the vascular intima of arterial walls [10]. Moreover, atherosclerosis remains unchanged with deficiency of Antigen Peptide Transporter 1 (TAP-1), an essential component of the MHC class I presentation complex that participates in cross-presentation [142]. Subsequently, these lipoproteins undergo oxidation in the subendothelial space, which recruits inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and DCs into the plaque via damage-associated molecular patterns [11,12]. Thus, immune checkpoint blockade may have unintended consequences in treating individuals with CVD and cancer, and conversely, PD-1 agonists may prove beneficial in CVD [154].Additional interactions between costimulatory molecules, such as CD40/CD40L and OX40/OX40L may mediate interactions between antigen-presenting monocytes and T cells. Thus, immune checkpoint blockade may have unintended consequences in treating individuals with CVD and cancer, and conversely, PD-1 agonists may prove beneficial in CVD [154].Additional interactions between costimulatory molecules, such as CD40/CD40L and OX40/OX40L may mediate interactions between antigen-presenting monocytes and T cells. Clinical trials targeting interactions between CD40 and CD40L in atherosclerosis were discontinued due to thrombotic complications; nevertheless, an antisense oligonucleotide approach targeting CD40 may represent a promising approach [149,158]. Furthermore, global OX40L overexpression and deletion increases and reduces fatty streak formation, respectively, in high-fat diet-fed mice [145,146]. While there have been no clinical trials on these targets to date, an anti-OX40 antagonistic antibody that elicits increased OX40+ T cells is currently under trial for individuals with solid tumors [160].

In response to the inflammatory signaling initiated by monocyte-derived cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate the plaque, where they further agonize plaque destabilization and increase the risk of myocardial infarction [12].

These methods have been championed in the cancer field, revealing novel insight into potential immunotherapeutic targets in the cancer setting [36,52,162]. Plaque-resident macrophages from asymptomatic individuals express IL1B, predicted to bind to IL1RAP, which encodes a component of the IL-1 receptor complex expressed by T cells [152].

For example, compared to conventional DCs (cDCs), antigen-expressing monocytes elicit more robust T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cell responses, during viral infection and airway inflammation, respectively [16,19].

Monocytes have traditionally been classified into classical, nonclassical, and intermediate subsets, and this framework has provided the basis for functional studies to date. Intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+ in humans, Ly6CintCCR2hiCX3CR1hi in mice) appear to represent a transition between classical and nonclassical subsets, contributing to the frequent contamination seen in monocytes during conventional flow cytometry [29,30].

In contrast, nonclassical monocytes circulate for at least 2 days in mice (with a half-life of 2.2 days) and 7 days in humans [32,33].

NR4A1 expression is controlled by the transcription factors KLF2 and C/EBPβ [5], but additional studies are needed to identify the signals driving this genetic program. Furthermore, the anti-tumoral activity of CCR2 inhibition in mice bearing Hepa1–6 liver tumors requires the presence of CD8+ T cells [50]. Furthermore, the anti-tumoral activity of CCR2 inhibition in mice bearing Hepa1–6 liver tumors requires the presence of CD8+ T cells [50]. In renal cell carcinoma specifically, transcripts associated with downstream activation of T cells, such as TNF, IL1B, IL6, and CCL3, are elevated [55]. Blockade of monocyte recruitment via CCR2 inhibition reduces macrophage-based production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-13, IL-15, and TNFɑ that can differentially impact T cell responses [50,57,58].

These observations warrant the continued exploration of Treg-monocyte interactions and potential for therapeutic targeting within the TIME. Antigen PresentationCross-presentation is particularly important for immune responses against tumor cells that express a high number of mutations but lack the machinery necessary for priming T cells directly.

Interestingly, tumor antigen in metastatic lung sites is redirected from macrophages to cDCs in CCR2-deficient mice, indicating that different APCs may compete for tumor antigen [44].

Monocytes upregulate both the PD-L1/2 and CD80/CD86 pathways as they enter the TIME and differentiate into TAMs [76].

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and PD-L1/2 have been highly successful in subsets of non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and other solid tumor patients [79], but whether these therapies inhibit monocyte-T cell interactions remains unclear.

Classical Ly6Chi monocytes (Table 1, Figure 2) represent the first immune cell population to arrive at the atherosclerotic plaque via recruitment by CCR2-CCL2, CX3CR1-CX3CL1, and CCR5-CCL5 signaling [84,85].
