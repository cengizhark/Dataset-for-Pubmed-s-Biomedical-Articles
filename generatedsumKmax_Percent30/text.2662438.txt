Moreover, it is also a good H-bond acceptor and can favorably interact with Tyr or Ser amino-acid residues on the NNRTI binding site surface, which are critical determinants for several NNRTIs affinities.10 In addition, reported evidence suggests that by introducing a cyano group, such as seen with the potent anti-HIV drug etravirine, the binding affinity of a quinazoline inhibitor to its target (containing Tyr30 and Tyr50) increased dramatically by 30,000-fold, due to hydrogen bond formation between the cyano nitrogen and two phenol hydroxyls of two tyrosines.11 Based on the aforementioned evidence, the 3-cyanomethyl moiety was selected to replace the 3-hydroxymethyl group of 3.

As stated above, because 4 is a good potential drug candidate for preclinical studies, a practical synthesis for scale-up of 4 is merited and has been developed. The total yield of 4 was significantly increased from 7.8% in the original seven-step synthesis6 to 32% in the new ten-step synthesis with optimized conditions, as shown in Scheme 1 and Table 1. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min (Figure 2) and were immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma fractions. The plasma samples obtained were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Data for each pharmacokinetic parameter were averaged and reported as mean ± standard deviation. The monolayers were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator with pre-warmed transport media. Testing compounds at final concentrations of 10 mM in HBSS were added to the apical compartment. Testing compounds at final concentrations of 10 mM in HBSS were added to the apical compartment.

Condensation of 8 with acetone in the presence of pyrrolidine yielded the fused angular pyranocoumarin 9 in an 81% yield. Additionally, this modified route to the key intermediate 11 has additional advantages for scale-up synthesis: it avoids production of the linear isomer, does not require chromatographic purification, and eliminates use of the costly reagent 3-chloro-3-methylbutyne-1 and the environmental contaminant N,N-diethylaniline. Compound 12 was treated with N-bromosuccinimide at a mole ratio of 1:1.2 in refluxing benzene for 4 h to produce exclusively 3-bromomethyl-4-methyl-DCK (13)4, 6 in 97% yield. In addition to 1H NMR shifts, the position of bromination was verified using NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) measurement, in which the signals of a methyl singlet (2.41 ppm, s) and 6-proton (6.80 ppm, d, J = 8.8 Hz) showed obviously increased response of ca. However, increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART regimens fail to respond to current antiretroviral drugs due to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants.1 Therefore, it is essential to develop additional potent anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action or resistance profiles different from those of current anti-HIV therapeutics. This fact indicated that the 3-methyl has higher reactivity than the 4-methyl during free–radical type bromination. We investigated the impact of various solvents and phase-transfer catalysts as shown in Table 2 to find a better solvent system. 3.5:1, which indicated that the product was a pair of isomers. 3.5:1, which indicated that the product was a pair of isomers.

Other phase-transfer catalysts, including benzyltriethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylammonium chloride, dibenzo-18-crown-6, and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, were also investigated in the two-phase reaction system (data not shown), but Bu4N+I− gave better results. Thus, a mixed solvent system of 95% EtOH/DMF (3:2 v/v) (entry 14) was developed. Thus, a mixed solvent system of 95% EtOH/DMF (3:2 v/v) (entry 14) was developed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis by using DAS Version 2.0. To improve solubility and thus increase absorption in vivo, compound 4 was then administered in 10% poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) 400 to rats via intravenous and oral routes. To improve solubility and thus increase absorption in vivo, compound 4 was then administered in 10% poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) 400 to rats via intravenous and oral routes. Meanwhile, compound 4 also showed low systemic clearance (0.052 L/min/kg) and a moderate half time (167 min). The modified synthesis gave a high overall yield of 32%, with minimized isomer formation, simplified purification, and elimination of high-cost reagents and toxic solvents, thus providing clear advantages for further scale-up synthesis.
