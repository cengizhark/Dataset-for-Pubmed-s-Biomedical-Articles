Interestingly, nuclear transport of TCF-1 remained unaffected with triptolide treatment till 24 h (Fig. The transactivation of TCF target genes induced by Wnt/β-catenin pathway constitutes the primary transforming event in colorectal cancer (CRC) [8]. The transactivation of TCF target genes induced by Wnt/β-catenin pathway constitutes the primary transforming event in colorectal cancer (CRC) [8]. The O-GlcNac modification at β-catenin was decreased in siOGT and triptolide treated samples as compared to controls. The inhibition of β-catenin reduces TCF transcriptional activity and induces apoptosis through Caspase 3 activation [9]. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins have been suggested to be involved in various human cancers including pancreatic cancer [2,24,25]. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins have been suggested to be involved in various human cancers including pancreatic cancer [2,24,25]. In recent years, drug discovery platforms have facilitated several new agents, gaining attention in directly targeting the β-catenin and its downstream partners [TCF/LEF1] to improve target therapy of cancer [3]. Over last 10 years, our group has been investigating water-soluble analog of triptolide (a diterpene triepoxide derived from a Chinese herb). Over last 10 years, our group has been investigating water-soluble analog of triptolide (a diterpene triepoxide derived from a Chinese herb). Even though significant advances have been made in order to understand the mechanism of action of Minnelide, we still do not have a full understanding of the pathways affected by this compound. Several other studies have also shown that levels of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation are upregulated in different cancers, including pancreatic cancer [11]. In this study we have evaluated the effect of Minnelide/triptolide on Wnt signaling pathway. Previous published reports showed the downregulation of oncogene β-catenin by several molecules inhibits the growth of breast and colon cancer cells [29,30]. LRP6 phosphorylation has been shown as a major event in activating β-catenin mediated Wnt signaling in colorectal and other cancers [32,33]. LRP6 phosphorylation has been shown as a major event in activating β-catenin mediated Wnt signaling in colorectal and other cancers [32,33]. LRP6 phosphorylation has been shown as a major event in activating β-catenin mediated Wnt signaling in colorectal and other cancers [32,33]. A natural polyphenol compound, Rottlerin was shown to decrease LRP6 expression and its phosphorylation in prostate and breast cancer cell lines. OGT has been shown to be overexpressed in many types of cancer such as colon cancer and breast cancer [13,37]. OGT has been shown to be overexpressed in many types of cancer such as colon cancer and breast cancer [13,37]. Published reports showed the OGT targets β-catenin in colon cancer [13]. Triptolide, a diterpene epoxide from Chinese plant Tripterygium wilfordii has been shown to be effective against various malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma [15], gastric cancer [16], osteosarcoma [17] and neuroblastoma through various mechanisms [18,19].

Interestingly, few studies have talked about how the overexpression of OGT in cancer regulates β-catenin translocation [38]. Interestingly, few studies have talked about how the overexpression of OGT in cancer regulates β-catenin translocation [38]. Interestingly, few studies have talked about how the overexpression of OGT in cancer regulates β-catenin translocation [38]. It can be summarized that triptolide affects O-GlcNAc modification of β-catenin, preventing its translocation in to nucleus. It can be summarized that triptolide affects O-GlcNAc modification of β-catenin, preventing its translocation in to nucleus. This was consistent with the findings that administration of Minnelide suppressed the growth of pancreatic tumors in STIM mice. We have summarized these findings in Supplementary Fig. 10 μM MG132 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used to treat MIA PaCa-2 cells followed by the treatment of 100 nM triptolide for 12, 24 and 48 h treatments. ChIP was performed by using standard protocol of Pierce Agarose Chip kit (Thermo Fisher scientific). Anti-β-catenin antibody (Chip grade, Millipore) was used to immunoprecipitate the β-catenin binding regions. The ChIP results were analyzed with quantitative real time PCR by using SP5 and c-Myc promoter region primers from Millipore. The ChIP results were analyzed with quantitative real time PCR by using SP5 and c-Myc promoter region primers from Millipore. Indeed, the past three decades spent on understanding the oncogenic pathways that fuel malignant transformation and proliferation have certainly not led to significant gains in the clinics for patients with this dismal diagnosis. Cell viability assayCell viability assays followed by siRNA and triptolide treatment were determined with the Dojindo Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Animal experimentsAll animal experiments were performed according to the University of Minnesota Animal Care Committee guidelines. STIM (syngenic tumor implantation model)Isolation of tumors and tumor implantation was done according to Majumder et al , 2015 [22]. After two weeks of tumor implantation, mice were treated with 0.21 mg/kg/day Minnelide by IP injection. Typically, the deregulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway genes (β-catenin and Axin) are implicated in the tumorigenesis at various sites including the colon and pancreas [1,3,4]. Furthermore we saw increased nuclear transport of β-catenin in pancreatic cancer lines to support this observation (Fig. Furthermore we saw increased nuclear transport of β-catenin in pancreatic cancer lines to support this observation (Fig. Furthermore we saw increased nuclear transport of β-catenin in pancreatic cancer lines to support this observation (Fig. The reduction was more effective when both (LRP6 and FZD) silencing RNAs were used in the culture at the same time. According to the classical Wnt signaling pathway, the transcription regulator β-catenin is targeted for degradation by a complex formed by GSK-3β and APC. 2F) was decreased to 40% of control upon inhibition of LRP6 and FZD1 genes. 3B).In vivo, Minnelide treatment reduced the RNA levels of Wnt and Fzd1, Gsk-3β, Axin2 while the Lrp6 and β-catenin transcript levels were found to be unaffected (Fig.
