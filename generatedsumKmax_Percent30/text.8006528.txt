In particular, because of the recent advancements in sequencing technologies that facilitate identifying disease-relevant TCRs, the T cell transductant system becomes an effective strategy to study antigen specificity of T cells expressing these TCRs. Expression of native human CD4 in 5KC cells, which endogenously express mouse CD4, was ineffective in improving responsiveness. Expression of native human CD4 in 5KC cells, which endogenously express mouse CD4, was ineffective in improving responsiveness. In contrast to native human CD4, expression of mutated human CD4 with two amino acid substitutions that engender higher affinity between CD4 and MHCII dramatically increased reactivity. In contrast to native human CD4, expression of mutated human CD4 with two amino acid substitutions that engender higher affinity between CD4 and MHCII dramatically increased reactivity. In contrast to native human CD4, expression of mutated human CD4 with two amino acid substitutions that engender higher affinity between CD4 and MHCII dramatically increased reactivity. When analyzing amino acid sequences of all HLA class II alleles that have been reported to date (ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/) (Robinson et al , 2015), nearly 100% of alleles share conserved amino acid residues at these positions (Table 3). Thus, the mutated CD4 expression is expected to be practical to enhance the reactivity of the majority of TCRs derived from CD4 T cells. Similar efforts have been given to restoring reactivity by CD8 T cell hybridomas and transductants that recognize peptides presented by MHC class I molecules (Wooldridge et al , 2010; Wooldridge et al , 2007; Devine et al , 2006). Affinity between CD8 and MHCI is naturally higher compared to that of CD4/MHCII (Xiong et al , 2001; Wyer et al , 1999), thereby leaving only small room to improve this interaction before losing antigen specificity that is determined by TCR/pMHC interaction (Wooldridge et al , 2010). Affinity between CD8 and MHCI is naturally higher compared to that of CD4/MHCII (Xiong et al , 2001; Wyer et al , 1999), thereby leaving only small room to improve this interaction before losing antigen specificity that is determined by TCR/pMHC interaction (Wooldridge et al , 2010). Affinity between CD8 and MHCI is naturally higher compared to that of CD4/MHCII (Xiong et al , 2001; Wyer et al , 1999), thereby leaving only small room to improve this interaction before losing antigen specificity that is determined by TCR/pMHC interaction (Wooldridge et al , 2010). In this report, we focused on molecules that are required for the primary TCR-pMHC interaction to reinforce sensitivity and specificity to antigen stimulation rather than secondary or activation molecules which may increase T cell activity without antigen specificity. In conclusion, we demonstrated that increased avidity between the TCR/CD3 complex and pMHC led to enhanced antigen stimulation in the T cell transductant system. Given this evidence, we hypothesized that expression of the mutant CD4 in T cell transductants greatly increases their antigen sensitivity. The retrovirus plasmid containing the murine CD3 genes (CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε, and the ζ chain (CD247) linked by 2A peptides) along with the ametrine fluorescent protein gene was kindly provided by Dr. Dario Vignali (Szymczak et al , 2004).2.1.2.TCR gene-encoding retroviral vectorsHuman TCR alpha and beta chain variable gene segments were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA that was isolated from each T cell clone (1B11 originally generated by Dr. Howard W. Davidson, T1D-3, T1D-4, and T1D-10 provided by Dr. William Kwok (Yang et al , 2014), clone 5 provided by Dr. Bart Roep (Eerligh et al , 2011), 489 and 233 provided by Dr. Ludvig Sollid (Tollefsen et al , 2006)) or synthesized based on the published sequence information (GSE.23G6 (Michels et al , 2017), 12-4.1 (Simone et al , 1997), Ob.3D1 (Wucherpfennig et al , 1994)). Each alpha or beta variable region gene segment was then connected to the mouse alpha or beta chain constant gene segment. Alpha and beta chain gene constructs from the TCR 1B11 were cloned into a MSCV-based vector encoding the neomycin-resistant or puromycin-resistant gene, respectively. For all others, alpha and beta chain gene fragments were connected with the porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A) peptide (Szymczak & Vignali, 2005) between them, followed by cloning into a MSCV-based retroviral vector encoding the neomycin-resistant gene, green fluorescent protein gene, or yellow fluorescent protein gene (Holst et al , 2006).2.1.3.MHC gene-encoding retroviral vectorsThe HLA-DQ8 alpha (DQA1*0301) and beta (DQB1*0302), the HLA-DQ2 alpha (DQA1*0501) and beta (DQB1*0201), the HLA-DP4 alpha (DPA1*0103) and beta (DPB1*0401), and the HLA-DR15 alpha (DRA*0101) and beta (DRB1*1501) gene fragments were amplified from RNA isolated from peripheral blood of individuals having these alleles and were confirmed to be identical to sequences published in the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/). The alpha and beta chain genes were connected by the P2A peptide, and cloned into a MSCV-based vector encoding the green fluorescent protein gene or the tag blue fluorescent protein 2 gene (Holst et al , 2006). One of most reliable ways to define antigens is to determine antigen specificity of tissue-targeting T cells such as tissue-derived T cell clones (Michels et al , 2017; Kent et al , 2005; Babon et al , 2016; Pathiraja et al , 2015). One of most reliable ways to define antigens is to determine antigen specificity of tissue-targeting T cells such as tissue-derived T cell clones (Michels et al , 2017; Kent et al , 2005; Babon et al , 2016; Pathiraja et al , 2015). 3.1.Responsiveness to antigens by 5KC T cell hybridomas expressing endogenous murine CD4We selected five TCRs expressed by T cell clones that were isolated from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, which is the immune-mediated form of diabetes, having the high genetic risk HLA-DQ8 gene (Yang et al , 2014; Eerligh et al , 2011) to be expressed on 5KC T cell hybridomas. The clone 5 TCR was isolated from a T cell clone that is derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pulsed with insulin B:6–22, whereas the other four clones (T1D-3, T1D-4, T1D-10, and 1B11) were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were enriched based on specificity to a mimotope of insulin B:9–23 having a substitution of arginine with glutamic acid at position 22 (insulin B:9–23R22E, amino acid sequence shown in Table 1), therefore respond to insulin B:9–23R22E more strongly than the native insulin B:9–23 peptide (Yang et al , 2014). 1, blue inverse-triangles [expressing human CD4] vs. black diamonds [no manipulation]). Of note, all amino acid residues in HLA molecules, DR1 and DQ8, that interact with CD4 are identical (Table 2), including those residues that contact the two mutated amino acids in CD4. Importantly, not only were the intensities of the responses elevated, but also responsiveness was seen to lower concentrations of peptides. In summary, expression of the mutated human CD4, which binds to HLA-DQ8 with greater affinity and thereby enhances affinity of the primary TCR-pMHC interaction, increased sensitivity to antigen stimulation as measured by IL-2 secretion by 5KC T cell transductants. In addition, the minimum peptide concentration by which IL-2 production is detectable was unaltered by introducing the additional CD3 genes. 4, red triangles vs. black diamonds and blue inverse triangles).
