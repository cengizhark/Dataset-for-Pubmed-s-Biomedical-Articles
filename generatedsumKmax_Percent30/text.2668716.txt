Of these, artemin (4.5-fold), FGF-5 (1.4-fold), and Gpx3 (1.4-fold) were significantly up-regulated in the EC-Rac1+/− brain compared to control. Emerging evidence suggests that neurons, glial cells, pericytes, and ECs, by virtue of their close proximity, form a topographical compartment termed the neurovascular unit, in which they are functionally coupled to maintain brain homeostasis (10, 11). Artemin-neutralizing antibodies had little effect on neuroprotection by control MBECs, but reduced neuroprotection by EC-Rac1+/− MBECs by half. In clinical application, less invasive delivery through blood flow and cerebrospinal fluid was ineffective because of the poor bioavailability at target tissues due, in part, to poor BBB penetration, low tissue diffusion, and short half-life (7–9). Furthermore, BM disruption commences within hours of the stroke onset (3). It remains to be determined, therefore, what the effect of sustained inhibition of endothelial Rac1 is on neurogenesis, which is coupled to angiogenesis within the neurovascular niche (52, 53). Our study is somewhat limited by the examination of transcriptional profile of Rac1 deletion in heart rather than brain ECs. The cDNA was reverse transcribed from 8 μg of RNA, coupled to Cy3 or Cy5 dye, and hybridized in four replicates to a microarray containing 19,549 70-mer oligonucleotides. The fold ratio of Rac1+/− versus Rac1+/+ for each reporter was statistically analyzed with one-sample Student's t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test and considered significant at P < 0.05. Functional annotation clusters were determined by the degrees of gene co-association between annotation terms and were ranked by the Enrichment Score, the geometric mean (in –log scale) of member's EASE scores. The mRNA abundance was normalized with GAPDH mRNA or 18S ribosomal RNA. Images were acquired by a confocal microscope (Leica). Rac1 null mutation in ECs was achieved by crossing Tie2 promoter and enhancer-driven Cre Tg with Rac1 floxed allele knock-in mice (15, 16). Rac1 null mutation in ECs was achieved by crossing Tie2 promoter and enhancer-driven Cre Tg with Rac1 floxed allele knock-in mice (15, 16). The NADPH oxidase activity was determined as diphenylene iodonium (DPI)–inhibitable lucigenin chemiluminescence by a luminometer (PerkinElmer). The medium was half changed every 3 days. The medium was half changed every 3 days. After centrifugation in 45% Percoll (20,000g), the top layer was plated in DMEM/F12 with 10% horse serum, 10% FCS, heparin, antibiotics, and ECGF. The cortical neurons (day 14) were co-cultured with MBECs (passage 3) in the presence of vehicle, goat anti-mouse artemin-neutralizing antibody or goat IgG (0.5 μg/ml, R&D) in the lower compartment. After co-culture, the neurons were deprived of the conditioned media (CM), treated with glucose-free DMEM under hypoxia for 2 hours (OGD), and resupplied with the CM and reoxygenated for 22 hours.

After co-culture, the neurons were deprived of the conditioned media (CM), treated with glucose-free DMEM under hypoxia for 2 hours (OGD), and resupplied with the CM and reoxygenated for 22 hours. P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Mice were bred and maintained with a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle and fed standard chow with tap water available ad libitum. Rac1flox/flox mice were crossed with Tie2-Cre Tg mice to generate EC-Rac1+/− (Tie2-Cre Rac1flox/+) and control (Rac1flox/+) mice. The genotyping PCR primers for Rac1 conditional and null alleles are described previously (1). Relative CBF returned to >95% of baseline values, indicating almost complete reperfusion without residual occlusion.Cerebral infarct volume was measured 22 hr after reperfusion. The following scoring system was used: 0, no motor deficits (normal); 1, flexion of the contralateral torso and forelimb on lifting the animal by the tail (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side but normal posture at rest (moderate); 3, leaning to the contralateral side at rest (severe); and 4, no spontaneous movement (critical).Absolute CBF in ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres was measured at the end of 2 hr MCAo using an indicator fractionation technique as described, with slight modifications (3). Cerebral blood flow in each hemisphere was calculated as follows: CBF (ml/100 g per min) = (hemisphere count (c.p.m.) The GTP-Rac1, total Rac1 and actin protein levels in mouse EC lysate were determined by immunoblotting analysis with Rac1 (BD Biosciences) and actin (Sigma) antibodies. Following the first and the second sorting, subconfluent ECs at passage 4 were used for the isolation of RNA.

Following the first and the second sorting, subconfluent ECs at passage 4 were used for the isolation of RNA. Consistent with these anatomical findings, neurological deficits were less severe in EC-Rac1+/− mice than in control mice (Fig. Briefly, fluorescent dye labeling was performed using the Atlas Powerscript Fluorescent Labeling Kit (Clontech). The cDNA was labeled via a coupling reaction to the Cy3 (2 replicates) or Cy5 (2 replicates) dye, then purified and concentrated. The cDNA was labeled via a coupling reaction to the Cy3 (2 replicates) or Cy5 (2 replicates) dye, then purified and concentrated. All spots were sequentially subjected to background subtraction, Lowess normalization, and brightness filtering that removed spots with intensities less than 200. The DAVID default setting was used for the source databases of gene annotation: Gene Ontology (GOTERM_BP_ALL, GOTERM_CC_ALL, GOTERM_MF_ALL), Protein Domains (INTERPRO, PIR_SUPERFAMILY, SMART), Pathways (BIOCARTA, KEGG_PATHWAY), and Functional Categories (COG_ONTOLOGY, SP_PIR_KEYWORDS, UP_SEQ_FEATURE). Complete details on the method for this analysis, the software and information on the biological data sets are available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/index.jsp. Neuroprotection in the transient MCAo model is thought to depend on two major factors: residual cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic region and CBF-independent, direct neuroprotective components, such as BBB functionality and growth factor–mediated neurosurvival. The standard GSEA null hypothesis is that the rank ordering of the genes in a given comparison is random and not associated with the order of the genes and/or treatment. The standard GSEA null hypothesis is that the rank ordering of the genes in a given comparison is random and not associated with the order of the genes and/or treatment. Phenotype permutation testing was used to assess the statistical significance of the MES, which was calculated as the fraction of 1,000 random permutations of the gene list. In the present study, we used curated gene sets (C2), archived at Molecular Signature Database, which were collected from various sources such as online pathway databases, publications in PubMed, and knowledge of domain experts.

For the maintenance of vascular integrity, ECs, together with the underlying basal lamina and astrocyte endfeet constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (2). Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice, and then free aldehyde was reduced with 50 mM NH4Cl. The fluorescent images were acquired by TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica). The NADPH oxidase activity was determined as DPI-inhibitable lucigenin chemiluminescence.Assessment of oxidative stress.Mouse ECs were grown to confluence on 96-well plates. Medium from the bottom well was incubated with assay buffer containing 0.5 mM guaiacol, 50 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.6 mM H2O2. At the end of incubation, non-adherent THP-1 cells were removed and the ECs were washed 3 times with PBS. Expression profiling of Rac1 haploinsufficient ECsThe independence from differences in blood flow of the reduction of infarct size in EC-Rac1+/− mice compared to controls suggested that decreasing EC Rac1 had a direct neuroprotective effect. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from C57/BL6 fetal mouse brains (∼E16). Primary cortical neurons were isolated from C57/BL6 fetal mouse brains (∼E16). Briefly, dissected cortices were digested with 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 10min, and DNase I (25 U/ml) for 5 min. The neurons were plated on cover glasses pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) at a density of 1−1.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. The pellets were suspended and digested in DMEM/F12 containing Collagenase/Dispase (1mg/ml) (Roche) and DNase I (25 μg/ml) at 37°C for 90 min, and centrifuged at 400g, 10 min, room temperature. Neurons on cover slips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 15 min, washed, and permeabilized with methanol at −20°C for 10 min. Following extensive washing with water, plates were dried and cell-associated dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid, and quantitated by absorbance at OD590 (14).
