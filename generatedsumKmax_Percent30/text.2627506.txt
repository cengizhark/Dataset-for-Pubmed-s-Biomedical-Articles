Results indicated that, in contrast to its striking effects on dendritic growth, erbin depletion did not significantly reduce axon growth (total average axon lengths: vector, 692.4 ± 70.2 μm; shRNA 1, 774.6 ± 78.1 μm; p = 0.43). In neurons overexpressing erbin, there was a small, but significant increase in total dendritic length compared with neurons expressing the vector only (supplemental Fig. 2D,E, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The phenotype is similar to but weaker than that observed in neurons in which erbin levels have been depleted by shRNA expression (Fig. The phenotype is similar to but weaker than that observed in neurons in which erbin levels have been depleted by shRNA expression (Fig. 3A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). 3A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This shRNA was highly effective at reducing expression of δ-catenin in transiently transfected tsa201 cells and in cultured rat cortical neurons, as assessed by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 3B,C, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These results indicate that acute knockdown of δ-catenin results in inhibitory effects on dendritic growth and branching similar to effects of genetic deletion of δ-catenin in cultures from mutant mice. Results in Figure 5, A and B, show that total dendritic arbor length in murine neurons is reduced to similar extents by erbin-specific shRNA treatment of wild-type neurons, by genetic deletion of δ-catenin, and by erbin-specific shRNA treatment of δ-catenin-null neurons. Overexpression of δ-catenin, but not p120ctn, can rescue the loss of erbin phenotypeWe next sought to examine whether the reduction in dendritic arbor growth resulting from depletion of erbin can be rescued by overexpression of δ-catenin by examining neurons that had been transfected with a vector control, erbin-specific shRNA, or erbin-specific shRNA plus δ-catenin. A region in the C terminus of δ-catenin adjacent to the arm repeats, but not including the PDZ domain, has been implicated in this functional role (Martinez et al , 2003; Kim et al , 2008).

A region in the C terminus of δ-catenin adjacent to the arm repeats, but not including the PDZ domain, has been implicated in this functional role (Martinez et al , 2003; Kim et al , 2008). To delineate the mechanism by which δ-catenin regulates dendritic length, we generated a series of C-terminal deletions of δ-catenin (Fig. To delineate the mechanism by which δ-catenin regulates dendritic length, we generated a series of C-terminal deletions of δ-catenin (Fig. 7A), including the N terminus alone (amino acids 1–529), N terminus plus arm repeats (amino acids 1–1035), and full-length lacking the C-terminal 4 aa (δ-PDZ interaction motif; amino acids 1–1243). Each member of the p120ctn family consists of a central domain consisting of nine armadillo (arm) repeats broken by a wedge between repeats 5 and 6 plus N- and C-terminal sequences that differ substantially between family members (Pokutta and Weis, 2007).

Loss of δ-catenin does not affect the levels of active Rac1 and RhoAPrevious studies have suggested a number of candidate proteins that might affect the ability of δ-catenin to regulate branching.

Loss of δ-catenin does not affect the levels of active Rac1 and RhoAPrevious studies have suggested a number of candidate proteins that might affect the ability of δ-catenin to regulate branching. It has been suggested that overexpression of δ-catenin inhibits RhoA via p190RhoGEF (Martinez et al , 2003; Kim et al , 2007) Furthermore, our lab has demonstrated previously that loss of p120ctn, a member of the same family as δ-catenin, results in a significant increase in the levels of active RhoA with a concomitant decrease in active Rac1 (Elia et al , 2006). Hence, we chose to examine whether loss of δ-catenin leads to alterations in the levels of active Rac1 and RhoA.

Hence, we chose to examine whether loss of δ-catenin leads to alterations in the levels of active Rac1 and RhoA. Contrary to our expectations, hippocampal neurons from δ-catenin mice examined at DIV 17 did not show any significant alterations in the levels of active Rac1 and RhoA compared with heterozygous littermate controls (active RhoA percentage of control: control, 100 ± 7.16; mutant, 103.44 ± 5.54; p = 0.71; active Rac1 percentage of control: control, 100 ± 4.96; mutant, 94.4 ± 14.05; p = 0.72; number of animals for RhoA: control, n = 9; mutant, n = 6; Rac1: control, n = 8; mutant, n = 5).

EGFP-δ-catenin showed a somewhat diffuse distribution including concentration associated with dendrites and spines (supplemental Fig. 4A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and some diffuse fluorescence in axons. Expression of EGFP-δ-catenin with vector only resulted in a pattern similar to that observed with EGFP-δ-catenin alone, whereas coexpression of shRNA 1 to erbin resulted in a more punctate pattern of expression of EGFP δ-catenin (Fig. These punctate structures were observed in the cell bodies, dendrites and axons, but more prominently in dendrites and cell bodies. The identity of organelles defined by these puncta is under investigation, but our preliminary data indicate that they do not colocalize with the golgi marker GM130, early endosome marker EEA1, or synaptophysin. A number of studies have indicated that LAP proteins, including scribble, erbin, and densin-180, are tethered to the membrane through their leucine-rich repeat motifs (Legouis et al , 2003; Navarro et al , 2005; Quitsch et al , 2005). 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Erbin has been proposed to be localized to synaptic sites.

The enhanced GFP (EGFP) δ-catenin Δ-PDZ was generated from the full-length construct by introducing a stop codon before the last four amino acids. ShRNA constructsshRNA 1 for erbin and shRNA for δ-catenin were generated in the pSuper-GFP construct. shRNA 2 for erbin was generated in the lentivirus vector (pLLX3.1).

Erbin is a member of the leucine-rich and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) (LAP) family of proteins, which in mammals includes erbin, densin-180 (Apperson et al , 1996), scribble (Murdoch et al , 2003), and lano (Saito et al , 2001). 1A, available at www. Results showed that each shRNA was highly effective in reducing erbin expression (supplemental Fig. 1D, E, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The rescue construct we used expresses only one of several human isoforms of erbin. 1E), with no significant effect on the number of primary dendrites (Fig.
