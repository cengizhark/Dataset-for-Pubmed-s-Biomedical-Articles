The assay was performed by using a commercial kit (Roche Scientific) following the instructions. In principle, cells were plated on 96-well dishes one day before the drug treatment, followed by drug treatment on day 2 and XTT assay on day 5 after drug addition. ChemistryAll reagents were used as received from commercial sources, unless specified otherwise, or prepared as described in the literature.

That is, once INH2 was treated with NaH in THF, the two MeO groups would result in the formation of two intermediates 28 and 29 in tautomeric equilibrium. Although multiple combined modality treatment strategies are available and continue to be improved, seeking for alternative therapeutics with a better therapeutic index remains a top priority of the drug development endeavors. Furthermore, a steric contribution to the observed selectivity (higher yield of 27) should also be taken into account as the ortho methoxy group would be occupying the same place as the methyl added to the amide nitrogen. in CH2Cl2 for 2 h smoothly gave the phenol 32 in 72% yield along with diphenol 33 in 3% yield. in CH2Cl2 for 2 h smoothly gave the phenol 32 in 72% yield along with diphenol 33 in 3% yield. Upon removal of the benzoyl groups from INH1 and INH2, the resultant thiazolyl amine 3 and 4 did not exhibit any anti-proliferative activity even at > 40 μM, indicating that benzoyl moiety is indispensable. To our delight, the other hybrid compound 6, containing the right moiety of INH2 and the left moiety of INH1, exhibited significantly improved anti-proliferation activities compared with our leads INH1 and 2. Additionally, deletion of the para-methoxyl group in INH2 resulted in the dramatic loss of bioactivity (7) and replacement of the methoxyl group in 7 with trifluoromethyl group would efficiently improve the bioactivity by approximately 1.5-2 fold (8). Target validation of INH analoguesNext, target validation was performed by using an affinity pulldown assay described previously 10. In a doses-dependent study, Nek2 was found to be undetectable on treating cells with INH1 (25 μM), or lower dosages of 6 or 21 (both at 6.25 μM), but not by the negative compound 22 (up to 25 μM) (Figure 2C). In comparison to the mock or 22-treated cells, 6 or 21 treated cells exhibited increased mitotic population with multipolar spindle configurations, presumably because of defective Hec1/Nek2 functionality (Figure 3A). Importantly, overexpression of Hec1 has been documented to associate with poor clinical outcomes of primary breast cancers as well as cases with multiple cancers 5, 6. Finally, the integrity of the thiazolyl ring and the amide bond in the middle of the scaffold is important for maintaining compound activity.
