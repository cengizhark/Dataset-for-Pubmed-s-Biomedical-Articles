Furthermore, the first TCR signaling events occur in nanoscale TCR clusters,17,21 suggesting that under appropriate conditions 50–100nM nano-aAPC could be used to engage and activate robust TCR signaling.

This suggests two possible therapeutic strategies: 1) a precision approach, where a small number of commonly shared neo-epitopes are expanded using off-the-shelf nano-aAPC, and 2) a fully personalized approach, where custom-tailored aAPC are designed after whole-exome sequencing and neo-epitope prediction.

C57BL/6j and Balb/C mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Nano-aAPC were manufactured by direct conjugation of MHC-Ig dimer and anti-CD28 antibody (37.51; BioLegend) to MACS Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described previously14.

Enrichment and ExpansionNano-aAPC were stored at a concentration of 8.3 nM (5×1012 particles/mL), and all volumes refer to particles at this concentration. 10 million CD8-enriched lymphocytes at ~108cells/ml were incubated with 10 μl of nano-aAPC for 1 hour at 4°C, for an approximate bead:cell concentration of 5000:1. The methods used to prepare libraries for analysis on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument are described in (47). The predictions of neo-epitopes were performed as previously described, with the exception that netMHCpan was used for epitope prediction.47 Briefly, genomic and transciptomic data sets were combined to identify expressed single base pair substitutions (SBS). The predictions of neo-epitopes were performed as previously described, with the exception that netMHCpan was used for epitope prediction.47 Briefly, genomic and transciptomic data sets were combined to identify expressed single base pair substitutions (SBS). This 17-amino acid peptide sequence was then processed by NetMHCpan version 2.4 to identify moderate (<500nM) to high (<50nM) affinity 9-amino acid peptides for all H-2d alleles. Full protein sequences were determined from Uniprot.org, from which nine flanking amino acids upstream and downstream of each mutation were extracted. Each 19-amino acid sequence was processed by NetMHC versions 3.4 and 3.2 to determine H-2b binding affinity of potential 8-, 9-, and 10-amino acid binders. A list of top candidate epitopes was compiled based on the epitope meeting either of the following criteria: 1) moderate to high affinity predicted binding affinity to H-2b allele, or 2) higher mutant peptide immunogenicity relative to the wild type peptide, based on the work of Castle, et al Cell mixtures were cultured for one week with 20 μl of Db-GP100 nano-aAPC prior to adoptive transfer to activate PMEL T cells. Cell mixtures were cultured for one week with 20 μl of Db-GP100 nano-aAPC prior to adoptive transfer to activate PMEL T cells. Cell mixtures were cultured for one week with 20 μl of Db-GP100 nano-aAPC prior to adoptive transfer to activate PMEL T cells. Mice were treated both the day of and the day after adoptive transfer with 30,000 units intraperitoneal IL-2. Transient lymphopenia was induced one day before adoptive transfer sub-lethal irradiation. Transient lymphopenia was induced one day before adoptive transfer sub-lethal irradiation. Tumor growth was monitored at 2-day intervals using digital calipers, with volume calculated using an ellipsoid approximate, volume = ½ × length × width. Mice were sacrificed once tumors reached 900 mm3. To assess efficacy of enrichment prior to culture, a known number of Thy1.1+ pmel TCR transgenic T cells specific for Db-GP100 melanoma antigen were mixed at a 1:1000 ratio with Thy1.2+ CD8 T cells from wild type B6 mice. Kb-TRP2 and Kb-SIINF consistently generated a higher frequency of antigen specific cells (13.9 ± 5.2% and 20.0 ± 9.2%, respectively) than Db-GP100 or Ld-A5 (4.3± 0.6 % and 6.9± 0.1 %, respectively) (Figure 3b). Thus, using our current formulations, nano-aAPC are a more effective reagent for antigen-specific enrichment. Thus, using our current formulations, nano-aAPC are a more effective reagent for antigen-specific enrichment. In comparison, approximately 35,000 Db-GP100and 150,000 Kb-SIINF specific T cells were generated from 107 T cells, indicating up to 5,000 fold expansion for each antigen. In comparison, approximately 35,000 Db-GP100and 150,000 Kb-SIINF specific T cells were generated from 107 T cells, indicating up to 5,000 fold expansion for each antigen. This is comparable to the robust expansion observed after viral infection in vivo.32To validate these estimates, we labeled naive T cell populations with the proliferation marker dye CFSE, which is diluted two-fold with every round of T cell division. This is comparable to the robust expansion observed after viral infection in vivo.32To validate these estimates, we labeled naive T cell populations with the proliferation marker dye CFSE, which is diluted two-fold with every round of T cell division. This is consistent with expansion by APC and artificial APC in humans, where antigen-specific responses after one week of stimulation are frequently not detectable.34 Furthermore, APC derived from cancer patients are often dysfunctional11 or immunosuppressive,12,13 further complicating the culture process. One week after “triple” E+E, antigen-specific T cells were detected by pentamer staining against each antigen of interest (Figure 3f). These ~17-amino acid sequences were then processed by NetMHC, an algorithm that predicts binding of peptides to human HLA as well as mouse MHC alleles using an artificial neural network48. This algorithm predicted amino acid neo-epitopes 8 to 10 amino acids in length for CT26 and B16 (Supplementary Table 2). E+E with nano-aAPC bearing these neo-epitopes was then performed and evaluated with MHC multimers at Day 7.Antigen-specific populations from Day 7 cultures were identified for both of the two CT26-derived candidate peptides tested (FPS and SAF). Figure 4b shows representative Day 7 cognate MHC staining of Ld-FPS and Ld-SAF activated samples. Peptide affinity for MHC as predicted by NetMHC (Supplementary Table 2) did not accurately predict E+E response; strong responders YTG and VDW had low predicted affinities at 991 and 9066 nM respectively, whereas the non-responder LAY and equivocal responder IAM had high predicted affinities at 69 and 5 nM respectively. Overall, the total number of cells generated at Day 7 approximated those observed with the shared antigens Db-GP100 and Ld-A5, ranging from 15,000 – 40,000 (Figure 4c), but was less than the shared antigens Kb-TRP2 and Kb-SIIN. B16–F10 cells, which form aggressive and poorly immunogenic melanomas, were implanted subcutaneously into B6 host mice and allowed to grow for eight days until tumors were palpable. B16–F10 cells, which form aggressive and poorly immunogenic melanomas, were implanted subcutaneously into B6 host mice and allowed to grow for eight days until tumors were palpable. Eighteen days after tumor injection, mean tumor volume in untreated mice was 757 ± 98 mm3, similar to Kb-SIINF treated mice (881 ± 104 mm3) but much greater than in Db-GP100/Kb-TRP2 treated mice (70 ± 40 mm3; p<0.05 by ANOVA with Tukey post-test).All mice in untreated and Kb-SIINF treated groups were sacrificed by day 22 due to excessive tumor burden.

Thus, E+E lymphocytes cultured from naive cells for only a week were able to delay and in some cases completely reject established B16 melanoma. Thus, E+E lymphocytes cultured from naive cells for only a week were able to delay and in some cases completely reject established B16 melanoma. After one week, 44,000 ± 21,000 NY-ESO1 specific cells were generated, representing approximately 1000-fold precursor expansion (Table 1, Figure 6). Widespread application of adoptive immunotherapy for cancer is limited by the availability of safe, cost-effective and convenient sources of tumor-specific cells.
