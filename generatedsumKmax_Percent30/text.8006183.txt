WC is also not only a measure of visceral but also subcutaneous fat, and while it is an imperfect measure, it is as good as, or perhaps even superior to, BMI as a superficial measure of abdominal obesity (5, 40–42).

WC is also not only a measure of visceral but also subcutaneous fat, and while it is an imperfect measure, it is as good as, or perhaps even superior to, BMI as a superficial measure of abdominal obesity (5, 40–42). Despite this correlation, which may have resulted in a loss of power to detect an association, adjusting for BMI in our WC analyses was a useful method to investigate if fat distribution (WC) was a predictor of RA risk independently of general obesity (BMI) (8). If they did report RA, medical records were reviewed by 2 independent rheumatologists following strict ACR criteria to ensure accuracy of diagnosis. Different test assays might have been used in community clinical sites, which might have had different performance characteristics. Seroconversion (initially testing seronegative and later testing seropositive) or seroreversion (the opposite of seroconversion) may have occurred after diagnosis, however, this is relatively uncommon, having been reported in <5% of patients in other research studies (46, 47). In sub-group analyses, we may not have had sufficient power to detect a statistically significant association after including all relevant covariates, as can be noticed where confidence intervals were wider and less precise than in analyses of other outcomes. Height was collected in 1976 in NHS and in 1989 in NHS II; weight was collected biennially from baseline for both cohorts. BMI was categorized as: underweight and normal weight (<25 kg/m2) (women with BMI <10 kg/m2 were excluded from analyses), overweight (25-<30 kg/m2), and obese (≥30 kg/m2)(18). The Pearson correlation between self-report and the average of technician measurements were 0.89 for WC and 0.97 for body weight (19). The Pearson correlation between self-report and the average of technician measurements were 0.89 for WC and 0.97 for body weight (19). CovariatesParticipants’ demographic, reproductive, clinical and behavioral factors have been collected with biennial questionnaires, including age, census tract median family income, smoking, age at menarche, menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use. A validated physical activity questionnaire (25) included inquiries about time spent engaged in several discretionary physical activities per week. Calculation methodology for a total estimate of physical activity in metabolic equivalents per week was published elsewhere (26). Abdominal obesity assessed using waist circumference (WC) has been shown in some studies to be a better measure of visceral fat (5), known to contribute to systemic inflammation (6, 7) more than adipose tissues at other anatomic sites. Statistical AnalysesWe calculated age-standardized descriptive statistics for women in NHS and NHS II cohorts by WC category (≤35 or >35 in.) Statistical AnalysesWe calculated age-standardized descriptive statistics for women in NHS and NHS II cohorts by WC category (≤35 or >35 in.) Exposure information was collected comparably across cohorts and the resulting larger sample size provided increased power to better assess age-specific effects. Univariate analyses were performed for covariates in unadjusted models. In multivariable analyses, we adjusted for time-varying covariates (significant in unadjusted models at p<0.10): age, cohort, smoking pack-years (0, 0–20, 20+ pack years), AHEI (quartiles), physical activity (quartiles of MET hours/week), and menopausal status and PMH use (premenopausal, and PMH never, current, or past use) (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Potential interaction of abdominal obesity (WC) by general obesity (BMI) was assessed in a separate model. All statistical tests were 2-sided at a statistical significance level of 0.05, performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). During up to 28 years of follow-up (2,748,799 person-years) in NHS and NHS II, 844 women developed RA. There was no significant interaction between WC and BMI (Pinteraction=0.69).When stratifying by serostatus, WC was again positively associated with seropositive RA in age-adjusted (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12–1.59) and multivariable-adjusted (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10–1.58) analyses; this association attenuated to null when BMI was added to the model (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91–1.42). There was no significant interaction between WC and BMI (Pinteraction=0.69).When stratifying by serostatus, WC was again positively associated with seropositive RA in age-adjusted (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12–1.59) and multivariable-adjusted (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10–1.58) analyses; this association attenuated to null when BMI was added to the model (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91–1.42).

Among women ≤55 years of age, WC was positively associated with RA in age-adjusted (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.30–2.17) and multivariable models (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.23–2.08) but this attenuated when BMI was added to the model (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.89–1.75). Body fitness and weight control may prevent future development of RA, especially for women with a high risk of RA (smokers or first-degree relatives of RA patients).
