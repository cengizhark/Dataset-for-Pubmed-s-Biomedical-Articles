We then sought the time at which the two SDFs started to differentiate. For this purpose, we first searched for the time bin (bin width = 1 ms) where the difference in the two SDFs was maximum between the cue onset and the longest SRT in that session. Physiological evidence has yet to be provided at the single-cell level. Note that even an (n+1) nonswitch trial and an (n+2) nonswitch trial could become an (n-1) nonswitch trial if the number of trials in a given block is 1 and 2, respectively.

Third, the SRTs and error rate were, indeed, not significantly different across nonswitch trials (Fig. Third, the SRTs and error rate were, indeed, not significantly different across nonswitch trials (Fig. Third, the SRTs and error rate were, indeed, not significantly different across nonswitch trials (Fig. Because the SRTs in the nonswitch trials were consistently shorter (Fig. Because the SRTs in the nonswitch trials were consistently shorter (Fig. Because the SRTs in the nonswitch trials were consistently shorter (Fig. Because the SRTs in the nonswitch trials were consistently shorter (Fig. We then sought the time at which the two ensemble average activities started to differentiate. Several studies show that the medial frontal cortex, especially the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), plays a key role in such a behavioral switching process (Shima et al , 1996; Nakamura et al , 1998; Rushworth et al , 2002; Nachev et al , 2005, 2007; Crone et al , 2006; Woodward et al , 2006; Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007).

This is likely because in both cases the monkey was primed for the stimulus that had been the target in the nonswitch trials. A plausible hypothesis is that the pre-SMA switch signal is implemented by the STN, through direct connections from the pre-SMA to the STN (Inase et al , 1999). Indeed, the STN has been suggested to play a role in the switching of movement (Monchi et al , 2006), yet the detailed underlying mechanism is unknown. Figure 3B illustrates the activity of the contra-switch neuron shown in Figure 3A but now as the animal performed the saccade Go/Nogo task. The ipsilateral Nogo activation suggests that the action of this neuron would be to inhibit ipsiversive saccades.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia plays an important role in motor control. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia plays an important role in motor control. We also show that the majority of these neurons appear to inhibit automatic inappropriate action but others were related to facilitation of controlled desired action. This switch-selective activity was direction selective and usually observed when the saccade was switched to the contralateral side. This switch-selective activity was direction selective and usually observed when the saccade was switched to the contralateral side. This switch-selective activity was direction selective and usually observed when the saccade was switched to the contralateral side. These actions operated in a spatially selective manner, which accorded with the direction of switching. These actions operated in a spatially selective manner, which accorded with the direction of switching. On the other hand, it could reflect a shift of attention or a direction-selective conflict between automatic and controlled saccades. The present study and our previous study (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007) show that both the STN and pre-SMA contain switch neurons. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the switch signal in the STN originates from the pre-SMA rather than the STN influencing the pre-SMA through output nuclei of the basal ganglia and the thalamus (Alexander et al , 1986). 6B), which roughly correspond to the pre-SMA projection area (Inase et al , 1999). 6B), which roughly correspond to the pre-SMA projection area (Inase et al , 1999). This conclusion resembles what has been shown by functional neuroimaging studies (Aron and Poldrack, 2006; Aron et al , 2007) but extends understanding of STN functions in several ways.

Figure 7 illustrates hypothetical circuit diagrams that can account for the underlying neuronal pathways. The suppression of ipsiversive saccades can be mediated by SNr neurons projecting to the SC on the opposite side (Fig. The suppression of ipsiversive saccades can be mediated by SNr neurons projecting to the SC on the opposite side (Fig. The suppression of ipsiversive saccades can be mediated by SNr neurons projecting to the SC on the opposite side (Fig. 7A, left) (Beckstead et al , 1981; Jiang et al , 2003) while contraversive suppression by SNr neurons projecting to the SC on the same side (Beckstead et al , 1981; Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983) (Fig. 7A, left) (Beckstead et al , 1981; Jiang et al , 2003) while contraversive suppression by SNr neurons projecting to the SC on the same side (Beckstead et al , 1981; Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983) (Fig. There may be several possibilities to explain this discrepancy.

Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. Third, some of the Nogo type neurons may have connections to the GPe, in addition to the connections to the SNr (Fig. The last possibility is interesting because behavioral switching is usually not a local motor phenomenon but requires several different processes such as the switch of mental operations (e.g., cognitive strategies or task implementations), enhancement of sensory responsiveness, cessation of a set of ongoing bodily movements and orienting responses, and facilitation of a desired set of motor activities.

Thus, what a cortical input needs to do is simply to pick one or a combination of them. Thus, what a cortical input needs to do is simply to pick one or a combination of them. On the other hand, cortical neurons (e.g., pre-SMA neurons) need to be connected appropriately to particular combinations of random connections.

On the other hand, cortical neurons (e.g., pre-SMA neurons) need to be connected appropriately to particular combinations of random connections. Our data suggest that the switch signal in the pre-SMA is implemented by the STN, consistent with the idea that the cortico-subthalamic pathway is ideal for quick implementation of behavioral control requiring a cessation of ongoing movement. The STN is involved in two major streams in the basal ganglia        circuitry linking the frontal cortex to the thalamus and brainstem motor areas: the 'hyperdirect'        pathway (Cortex-STN-GPi/SNr) and the 'indirect' pathway (Cortex-Striatum-GPe-STN-GPi/SNr). There was a difference in activity        well before saccade onset, but this reflected the primed target direction (i.e., higher activity for the        contralateral target), not the decision for switching. Rastergrams and SDFs are aligned with cue onset. Data for the pre-SMA derived from our previous study (Isoda and        Hikosaka, 2007). Behavioral tasksDuring experimental sessions, the monkey was placed in a sound-attenuated room and seated in a primate chair with its head immobilized. Data for the pre-SMA derived from our previous study (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007). Behavioral tasks were under control of a QNX-based real-time experimentation data acquisition system (REX; Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health (LSR/NEI/NIH), Bethesda, MD). In this task, a peripheral cue appeared transiently for 100 ms after the monkey had fixated on the FP for 800 ms. Following a short delay (200 ms for monkey T, 100 ms for monkey S), the white FP changed to one of the two stimulus colors as a cue. A reward was given after the monkey captured the target stimulus and maintained the fixation for another 300 ms. Recording proceduresEye movements were recorded with the use of the magnetic search-coil technique with temporal resolution of 1 ms (Robinson, 1963). The electrode was driven by a hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-97A; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) through a stainless steel guide tube, which was used to penetrate the dura and was held in place by a grid that was fixed inside the recording chamber (Crist et al , 1988). The head then was fixed to the stereotaxic device, and the brain was cut into blocks in the coronal plane parallel to the electrode penetrations. Frozen sections were cut every 50 μm using a microtome and were stained for Nissl using thionin. To determine the presaccadic interval for the above comparison, we first analyzed all of the data using time windows ranging from 50- to 100-ms duration prior to saccade initiation with a 5-ms step.

These observations, together with the basal ganglia network models (DeLong, 1990; Mink, 1996; Nambu et al , 2002) (supplemental Fig. To determine the statistical significance of difference in the peak SDF values between Go and Nogo trials, we used a resampling procedure (n = 1,000) to estimate a 95% confidence interval of the activity difference (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).The behavioral differentiation time for the saccade Go/Nogo task was measured in an analogous manner to that in the saccade overriding task.
