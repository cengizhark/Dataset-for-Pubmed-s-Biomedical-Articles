A Flag-tagged mouse Sox7 was cloned into pTRE2 and transfected into Tet-inducible C4-2 cells. Following isolation of two stable clones, the removal of Dox from their culture media was able to induce Sox7 protein expression after 48 hours (two examples, Figure 6C).

In 1989, this 8p allelic loss was initially observed by Vogelstein et al  in colorectal cancer (30). The Sox7 gene encodes a transcription factor that can both enhance and inhibit transcription (21). Emerging evidence indicates that other proteins, such as the SFRPs which inhibit the WNT receptor, are also capable of attenuating WNT signaling even in the presence of down-stream mutations (41). Despite these advances in understanding the relationship between catenin, WNT signaling, and tumor growth, our current understanding of β-catenin regulation remained limited to the existence of control via the cytoplasmic destruction complex, even though Zorn et al  had demonstrated back in 1999 that β-catenin function could be inhibited by Sox17, at least in Xenopus (40). The Zorn data proved to be a valuable clue to uncovering Sox7 functionality in human cells. Our data indicate that Sox7 is inactivated in the HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell line and that ectopic Sox7 expression can suppress CRT activated by an endogenous mutant β-catenin. These data is consistent with our observation that Sox7 mediates the degradation of active S33Y β-catenin via an APC-independent mechanism (Figure 4D). Indeed, the molecular basis of aberrant stabilizations of β-catenin in the majority of prostate cancer cases is not due to defects in the β-catenin or even the multi-component destruction complexes, as mutational alterations of β-catenin or of other known components of the destruction complexes are rare in prostate cancer cells (8, 9). Therefore, it is our conclusion that the Sox7 gene most likely encodes a candidate tumor suppressor that plays an important role in suppressing various cancers, and one of Sox7 functions is to serve as an independent checkpoint for β-catenin transcriptional activity.

Scores ranged from 0 to 3+, and any samples with 2–3+ as an IHC score were defined as having normal levels of Sox7 expression. This total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA, and qPCR was carried out in a 20-µl volume using iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad, cat# 170-8882) on a Bio-Rad iCycler. Methylation analysisBisulfite modification of genomic DNA followed by PCR amplification was carried out as described previously (46). Primer sequences for MSP and bisulfite sequencing PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Allelic imbalance analysisTissue specimens were manually microdissected, then the tumor DNA was isolated from tissue samples as previously described (20). First, the normal DNA samples were genotyped for chromosome 8p (ch8p) heterozygosity using nine bi-allelic single-nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) on chromosome 8p, to select for an informative marker for subsequent allelic imbalance analysis. All transfections were carried out with lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogene) and indicated plasmid constructs.

Down-regulation of Sox7 protein and mRNA expression in primary prostate tumorsImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to evaluate Sox7 protein expression in archived paraffin-embedded specimens. MSP primers were designed to interrogate the methylation status of CpG sites overlapping Exon 1 and the CpG island of Sox7 (Figure 2A). MSP primers were designed to interrogate the methylation status of CpG sites overlapping Exon 1 and the CpG island of Sox7 (Figure 2A). The stability of β-catenin is regulated by a multi-component cytoplasmic destruction complex containing APC, axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) (2). A panel of nine SNP markers (NCBI RefSNP numbers 1124, 3185, 3850751, 3888179, 3258, 11362, 3112, 532841, and 14879 from 8p21.2 to 8p23.2) were used to evaluate allelic imbalance in these tumors.

Of the remaining 18 tumors, eleven (61%) tumors contained allelic loss in at least one SNP marker in this region. In colorectal cancers, mutational inactivations of the APC/axin genes or mutational activations of the β-catenin gene disrupt the interaction between β-catenin and this cytoplasmic destruction complex, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin in the nucleus (1). A Sox7 mutant construct that only retained the DxxEF structure (Figure 4A, Sox7-M, DRNEFGGG) was still capable of binding to β-catenin (Figure 4C, lane 3), implying that the glutamic acid (E) and phenylalanine (F) within this motif might play significant roles in the binding process.We also evaluated whether Sox7-Δ is still capable of suppression β-catenin-mediated CRT in H1299 cells. Unlike wild-type Sox7, increased dose of Sox7-Δ did not result in further CRT inhibition because of a significant increase in the transcription of pOF-Flash plasmid by Sox7-Δ (Figure 4B). S33Y β-catenin mutation was initially identified in SW48 colorectal cancer cell line, and this mutant is resistant to APC mediated degradation (1). In summary, this data suggest that ectopic expression of Sox7 mediates the degradation of active β-catenin in an APC-independent mechanism.

In summary, this data suggest that ectopic expression of Sox7 mediates the degradation of active β-catenin in an APC-independent mechanism. If this is the case, the inactivation of Sox7 function would be necessary for developing colorectal cancer, because it is known that aberrant WNT/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in colorectal cancer development (1).

We failed to amplify the correct size PCR product from tumor DNA after repeated attempts, as well as with MSP primer sets #1 or #2 for the remaining two samples.
