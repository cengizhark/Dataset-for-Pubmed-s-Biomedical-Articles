To confirm our conclusion that the acidic tail of HMGB1 plays a critical role in this interaction, we collected HSQC spectra of the 1:1 complex of drTLR5 and 15N-tailless HMGB1 (red spectra) and compared with the 15N-tailless HMGB1 spectrum (green spectra) (Figure 5C). The importance of the C-terminal tail region of HMGB1 in binding and activating TLR5 signaling was also confirmed by in vitro SEAP assay (Figure 5D).

This study demonstrated a functional role of TLR5 via this route of administration, providing a rationale to explore the activation/inhibition of TLR5 by HMGB1 and TH1020 in vivo. Post hoc tests did not reveal a significant difference between these two doses of TH1020. Here we successfully characterized HMGB1 as a TLR5 ligand (Figure 1 & 5) and demonstrated HMGB1-induced TLR5 activation is NF-κB-driven (Figure 2 & 3) and releases downstream proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 4) Notably, we also showed that activation of peripheral TLR5 by HMGB1 and flagellin induces pain following subcutaneous administration in rats (Figure 6A & B). Previously, Means et al  showed that the functional expression of some TLRs including TLR5 was absent in the widely used platform cell lines such as RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, murine bone marrow-derived DCs, and resident/thioglycollate peritoneal macrophages (Means et al , 2003). Similarly, Ji and coworkers showed expression of TLR1-TLR9 in mouse DRG neurons, but reported the unique distribution pattern of TLR5 among other TLRs in sensory neurons with Aβ-fibers (Xu et al , 2015). Similarly, Ji and coworkers showed expression of TLR1-TLR9 in mouse DRG neurons, but reported the unique distribution pattern of TLR5 among other TLRs in sensory neurons with Aβ-fibers (Xu et al , 2015). Structurally, HMGB1 is composed of three domains: A-box, B-box and the 30-residue C-terminal acidic tail primarily composed of aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues (Watson et al , 2007). Structurally, HMGB1 is composed of three domains: A-box, B-box and the 30-residue C-terminal acidic tail primarily composed of aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues (Watson et al , 2007). Our NMR data suggest that the C-terminal acidic tail (residues 185-215), the basic linker-region (residues 170-184), few residues of the N-terminus and the A-(residues 14-83) and B- (residues 88-164) boxes of full-length HMGB1 are critical for binding and activation of TLR5 by HMGB1 (Figure 5). Although a few residues of the A- and B-boxes of the HMGB1 tailless mutant show significant chemical shift perturbation, the rest of the residues in these domains are almost structurally identical with the full-length protein (Figure S4A, green labels and Table S1) confirming that the tail region is primarily interacting with the drTLR5 ECD. Adding to this list, this study shows that subcutaneous HMGB1 and flagellin can signal through TLR5 and create pain amplification in vivo (Figure 6A & B). A complementary mechanism may also involve activation of peripheral innate immune cells that express TLR5, leading to release of inflammatory mediators that sensitize peripheral terminals of sensory neurons (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010, Ren and Dubner, 2010). A complementary mechanism may also involve activation of peripheral innate immune cells that express TLR5, leading to release of inflammatory mediators that sensitize peripheral terminals of sensory neurons (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010, Ren and Dubner, 2010). A complementary mechanism may also involve activation of peripheral innate immune cells that express TLR5, leading to release of inflammatory mediators that sensitize peripheral terminals of sensory neurons (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010, Ren and Dubner, 2010). HMGB1 has recently emerged as a DAMP that can activate innate and adaptive immunity and drive host inflammatory responses (Lotze and Tracey, 2005). The media was removed from the 96-well plate and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (neither 1% penicillin/streptomycin nor 1% L-glutamine) and treated with the appropriate concentration of compounds. On day 3, 90 µL media was transferred to a black 96-well plate and 10 µL of 0.05 mg/mL 2, 3-diaminonapthalene (Sigma Aldrich, MO) in 0.62 M HCl were added to the media. The Fmoc-protected amino acids (0.5 mmol), HATU (0.5 mmol) and DIPEA (0.5 mmol) in 4 mL DMF were mixed with Rink Amide resin (0.1 mmol) with a substitution level of 0.45 mmol/g for the coupling step.

While multiple prior studies have identified the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in pain amplification via actions at peripheral nerve terminals and/or the spinal cord (Qi et al , 2011), the work of Ji and colleagues raises the potential of TLR5 being involved in pain processing when they discovered that TLR5 is co-expressed with neurofilament-200, a marker of Aβ fiber neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) long associated with pain amplification under inflammatory or injury conditions (Xu et al , 2015). Protein overexpression was induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cell pellet for CBP tag-15N HMGB1 (full-length) was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 (Buffer A), while His tag-15N HMGB1 full-length and HMGB1 tailless were resuspended in 40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and stored at −80°C.Modified protocols of previously published procedures were used to purify CBP tag-15N isotope labeled HMGB1 (full-length), 6XHis tag- 15N isotope labeled HMGB1 (full-length) and 6X His tag- 15N HMGB1 tailless proteins (Figure S5B and S5C).

Fluorescence anisotropy assayApparent Kd values were determined by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of 200 nM or 5 µg/ml fluorescein-labeled HMGB1 as a function of increasing concentrations of drTLR5 ECD and MD-2 proteins. The labeled protein was incubated with varying amounts of the target protein (drTLR5 ECD and MD-2) for 30 mins at room temperature in binding buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). NMR SpectroscopydrTLR5/HMGB1 interactions were determined by solution NMR spectroscopy on the CBP- and 6X His tags containing full-length and tailless 15N uniformly labeled HMGB1 proteins ranging from 80–100 µM, 10% (v/v) 2H20 in 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM deuterated DTT. Titrations of 1:1 and 1:2 (mol/mol) drTLR5/HMGB1 (CBP- and 6X His tag containing) were used All spectra were collected either in a Varian 800 MHz or 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with triple resonance cryoprobe at 25°C housed at Univ.

To determine whether peripheral TLR5 functionally contributed to allodynia, either 0 (vehicle control), 3, or 10 µg flagellin was administered (100 µl; saline vehicle). Rats received at least three 60-min habituations to the test environment before behavioral testing. Statistical analysisAnimal study: Mechanical allodynia was analyzed as the interpolated 50% thresholds (absolute threshold). Differences between treatment groups were determined by unpaired student’s t-test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important components of the innate immune system that regulate detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs; a.k.a “alarmins”) (Akira and Takeda, 2004). oxPAPC efficiently inhibited both PAM2 and LPS-induced activation of TLR2 and TLR4 (Figure 1B) without significant cellular toxicity at 30 µg/ml (Figure S2A). Control experiments confirmed that TH1020 also inhibited flagellin-induced TLR5 activation in HEK-hTLR5 cells as reported previously (Yan et al , 2016) with no apparent cytotoxicity (Figure S2G). In sterile brain injury (Liesz et al , 2011) and neuropathic pain (Tanga et al , 2005, Kim et al , 2007), TLR2- and TLR4-mediated proinflammatory signaling plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the response to neural traumas. HMGB1 activates NF-κB translocation and proinflammatory cytokine productionActivation of the TLR5 receptor by flagellin from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria culminates in NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-8 (Hayashi et al , 2001). With 30 ug/ml oxPAPC, we observed a significant inhibition of TNF-α secretion upon PAM2- and LPS-mediated TLR2 and TLR4 activation but no effect on flagellin-induced TLR5 stimulation, suggesting the specificity of oxPAPC to TLR2 and TLR4. These DAMPs bind to cell surface TLRs of microglia, the first responder resident immune cell of the CNS (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010, Grace et al , 2014). C-terminal tail of HMGB1 interacts with TLR5To determine the binding affinity and structural basis of the HMGB1-TLR5 interaction, fluorescence anisotropy and NMR spectroscopy were performed on the complex of full-length HMGB1 and the recombinant zebrafish Danio rerio ortholog of TLR5 (drTLR5) extracellular domain (ECD). By contrast, no interaction was observed between HMGB1 and the control protein, bovine serum albumin.The binding mode of the drTLR5-HMGB1 interaction was further elucidated by solution NMR spectroscopy.
