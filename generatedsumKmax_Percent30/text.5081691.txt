While still capable of contributing to all three germ lineages, primed epiblast stem cells are thought to be more developmentally restricted than naïve embryonic stem cells and undergo X- chromosome inactivation (Bao et al , 2009; Guo et al , 2009; Heard, 2004; Silva et al , 2008). In all samples with SirT1 deleted, there were reductions in Nanog and Klf2 proteins and increases in Fgf5 and Otx2 proteins (Figure 3C). Loss of SirT1 causes Oct4 Reorganization at Naïve and Primed EnhancersThe shift from naïve to primed pluripotency is characterized by a dramatic reorganization of Oct4 occupancy at enhancer regions (Buecker et al , 2014; Factor et al , 2014; Yang et al , 2014). To determine if decreased Oct4 binding affects Oct4 distal enhancer activity, we performed Oct4 enhancer luciferase reporter assays in wild type and SirT1 knock out ES cells (Tesar et al , 2007; Yeom et al , 1996). Indeed, chimeric contribution of pluripotent primed cells is significantly less efficient than that of pluripotent naïve cells (Brons et al , 2007; Han et al , 2010; Tesar et al , 2007). To define genes whose transcripts are activated or repressed by Oct4, we used previously reported Oct4 ChIPseq data in the naïve and EpiLC state (Buecker et al , 2014) and our RNAseq expression data in the wild type naïve and primed EpiLC states. The primed state can also be induced in vitro by the addition of Fgf and Activin A to naïve cells (Brons et al , 2007; Tesar et al , 2007; Thomson et al , 2011). We used this transcriptome data to study the role of Otx2 by first grouping transcripts that were downregulated or upregulated in wild type primed EpiLCs compared to wild type naïve ES cells (Figure 5A-B). There was a clear normalization toward the wild type naïve transcriptome profile in these cells (Figure 5A-B), indicating that the upregulation of Otx2 per se helps drive the shift toward the primed state in SirT1 knockout ES cells.Otx2 is thought to promote the primed state through the binding and genomic reorganization of Oct4. In this report, we describe a close association between SirT1 and Oct4 in embryonic stem cells, both physically and functionally. Interestingly, human embryonic stem cells derived from pre-implantation blastocysts resemble primed murine stem cells more than naïve cells (Brons et al , 2007; Rossant, 2008; Tesar et al , 2007). A key step in driving cells toward the primed state is induction of Otx2, which interacts with Oct4 to alter the enhancers bound by this pluripotency factor and to generate the primed transcriptome (Buecker et al , 2014; Yang et al , 2014). Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicate a role for SirT1 in induced pluripotency (Mu et al , 2015). While acetylation of both Sox2 (Mu et al , 2015) and Oct4 increase in ES cells lacking SirT1, only Oct4 occupancy of the Otx2 enhancer was significantly elevated, consistent with the model that acetylation of Oct4 may be driving the naïve to primed transition. In addition, human induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells also exhibit features of the primed state of pluripotency (Yamanaka et al , 2007; Yu et al , 2007), while mouse IPS cells naturally revert to the naïve state (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). It is clear that naïve cells are more robust than primed cells, both in their growth rate and in their ability to contribute to the differentiated cell population in injected blastocycts (Brons et al , 2007; Dodsworth et al , 2015; Silva et al , 2008; Tesar et al , 2007). Indeed, we found that knocking out SirT1 also slowed the growth of naïve cells and by some assays altered their morphology to resemble primed cells. For example, toxic environmental agents could trigger DNA damage, activation of PARPs, depletion of NAD and inactivation of SirT1, thereby imposing a roadblock to continued embryonic development. Embryoid bodies were formed in 10cm Costar Ultra Low Attachment (Corning) plates.Differentiation of naïve mESC to primed EpiLCs was performed as previously described (Buecker et al , 2014; Hayashi et al , 2011). In addition primed cells are prone to greater heterogeneity in gene expression (Bernemann et al , 2011; Gafni et al , 2013; Osafune et al , 2008), making it difficult to obtain unbiased lineage-specific specification. Co-IPs were performed using Pierce’s direct co-IP kit. FASTQ files were aligned to the NCBI37/mm9 reference genome using the Tophat aligner. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation qPCRChromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling). Oct4 Enhancer Luciferase Reporter AssayMouse Oct4 proximal and distal enhancers were cloned into pGL3 as previously characterized (Tesar et al , 2007). Oct4 Enhancer Luciferase Reporter AssayMouse Oct4 proximal and distal enhancers were cloned into pGL3 as previously characterized (Tesar et al , 2007). One important observation is the dramatic difference in the enhancer chromatin landscape between the naïve and primed states (Buecker et al , 2014; Factor et al , 2014; Sohni et al , 2015; Tesar et al , 2007; Yang et al , 2014; Yeom et al , 1996). Oct4 enhancer activity shifts from a distal enhancer dependent on Oct4 itself in naïve cells to a proximal, Oct4-independent enhancer in primed cells without affecting the total expression level of the gene (Buecker et al , 2014; Yang et al , 2014). A critical step in this process is the ability of pluripotent epiblast cells to coordinate the balance between self-renewal and lineage specification (Kunath et al , 2007; Niwa, 2007; Silva and Smith, 2008). Oct4 is required for the early upregulation of Otx2 and Otx2 is required for the recruitment of Oct4 to “primed” enhancers (Acampora et al , 2013; Buecker et al , 2014; Yang et al , 2014). Inactivation of SirT1 in wild type ES cells therefore provides a mechanism for the induction of Otx2 early in the naïve to primed transition. Lastly, knocking down Otx2 expression in SirT1 knock out cells reverses the induction of the primed network, thus linking the SirT1-Oct4-Otx2 axis to the naïve to primed transition of epiblasts. We decided to use mouse embryoid bodies to model the differentiation that normally occurs in early post-implantation embryos (Desbaillets et al , 2000). We decided to use mouse embryoid bodies to model the differentiation that normally occurs in early post-implantation embryos (Desbaillets et al , 2000). We also found that SirT1 is localized within the nucleus as evidenced by its colocalization with DAPI and the activating histone modification, (H3K4me3)(Heintzman et al , 2007) (Figure 1D). No SirT1 signal was detected in SirT1 null embryonic stem cells demonstrating the specificity of the antibody (Figure 1B).To assess SirT1 expression during the naïve to prime transition we employed the previously described EpiLC differentiation protocol (Buecker et al , 2014; Hayashi et al , 2011; Yang et al , 2014). Genome wide transcriptional analysis of naïve ES cells and EpiLCs revealed significant overlap with previously characterized primed pluripotency datasets (Kim et al , 2013; Buecker et al , 2014) (Figure S1 A-D). p53, a canonical target of SirT1 deacetylation (Vaziri et al , 2001), was found to be hyper-acetylated at Lysine 379 in EpiLCs (Figure 1C), indicating a reduction in SirT1 activity during the transition to primed pluripotency. Activation of the Oct4 distal enhancer is associated with the promotion of the naïve state, while Oct4 proximal enhancer activity is associated with primed pluripotency (Tesar et al , 2007; Theunissen et al , 2014; Yeom et al , 1996) (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Oct4 hyper-acetylation was observed in wild type ES cells treated with the SirT1 inhibitor, Ex-527 (Figure S2C-D)(Napper et al , 2005; Solomon et al , 2006). Myc-tagged Oct4, SirT1, and catalytically inactive SirT1H355A (Rodgers et al , 2005) were co-transfected. Myc-tagged Oct4, SirT1, and catalytically inactive SirT1H355A (Rodgers et al , 2005) were co-transfected. Naïve ES cells are able to form colonies from single ES cells while single primed cells either differentiate or undergo apoptosis (Brons et al , 2007; Tesar et al , 2007). During embryo implantation, cells of the epiblast layer transition from the naïve state to the “primed” pluripotency state (Arnold and Robertson, 2009; Brons et al , 2007; Kojima et al , 2014; Tesar et al , 2007). These “primed” genes exhibited extensive overlap with previously published data sets (Buecker et al , 2014) (Kim et al , 2013) (Figure S1A-D). 931 of these genes overlap with the differential expression observed during the transition from wild type naïve ES cells to wild type primed EpiLCs. Similar overlap was also observed between the expression changes induced by loss of SirT1 and previously published data sets comparing the naïve and primed states (Buecker et al , 2014; Kim et al , 2013) (Figure 3A). The positive correlation between the gene network induced during the transition from naïve to primed EpiLCs and the expression changes caused by the loss of SirT1 had a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of R=0.669 (Figure 3B).Consistent with a shift towards primed pluripotency in SirT1 null ES cells, our RNAseq analysis revealed changes in the expression of important markers of primed pluripotency. To acutely remove exon 4 of SirT1, a domain required for SirT1 deacetylase activity (Cheng et al , 2003), we employed a tamoxifen-inducible cre.
