The SEC is a positive regulator of transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Ser2 of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) via the associated p-TEFb dimeric complex comprising Cdk9 and cyclin T1 or T2. The SEC is a positive regulator of transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Ser2 of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) via the associated p-TEFb dimeric complex comprising Cdk9 and cyclin T1 or T2. This releases RNA Pol II from the “paused” state at the promoter proximal regions of many active genes and leads to their productive elongation (Luo et al , 2012b). This releases RNA Pol II from the “paused” state at the promoter proximal regions of many active genes and leads to their productive elongation (Luo et al , 2012b). While similar amounts of Cdk9 were coprecipitated by ENL and cyclin T1, less ENL was pulled down indirectly by cyclin T1 than directly by ENL antibody. While similar amounts of Cdk9 were coprecipitated by ENL and cyclin T1, less ENL was pulled down indirectly by cyclin T1 than directly by ENL antibody. This is consistent with the fact that p-TEFb (cyclin T1/Cdk9) associates with different partners besides SEC (e.g., BET domain proteins) (Luo et al , 2012a), and further implicates that the Pfn1/SEC interaction is mediated directly by the PLP motif in ENL. We detected partially overlapping distribution of p-TEFb and ENL, consistent with a prior report (Luo et al , 2012a). Importantly, endogenous Pfn1 showed a narrow size distribution that overlaps with both ENL and p-TEFb (Figure 5F). However, MYC was inhibited when Pfn1 was re-expressed (Figure 6E). Using antibodies for ENL, Cdk9, and cyclin T1 and MYC-specific primers (He et al , 2011), we detected significant inhibition of chromatin occupancy of the SEC by both NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). Further, H3K36me3, a positive transcriptional marker depending on transcriptional elongation by p-Rpb1(Ser2) (Edmunds et al , 2008), was significantly decreased at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). Further, H3K36me3, a positive transcriptional marker depending on transcriptional elongation by p-Rpb1(Ser2) (Edmunds et al , 2008), was significantly decreased at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). In contrast, the biological function of nuclear Pfn remains poorly understood, despite its presence in the nucleoplasm, nuclear speckles, and Cajal bodies (Skare et al , 2003). In contrast, the biological function of nuclear Pfn remains poorly understood, despite its presence in the nucleoplasm, nuclear speckles, and Cajal bodies (Skare et al , 2003). Consistent with the GSEA results, we also detected significant downregulation of multiple gene sets related to proliferation, metastasis, transcription, and translation (Figure 7D; Table S4B). It was recently reported that SEC inhibition via ENL deletion sensitizes leukemia cells to the BET inhibitor JQ1 (Wan et al , 2017). When the average tumor volumes in each group reached ~70 mm3, we randomly divided and treated them daily with vehicle or JQ1 for 3 weeks.

When the average tumor volumes in each group reached ~70 mm3, we randomly divided and treated them daily with vehicle or JQ1 for 3 weeks. As the first actin-binding protein identified decades ago (Carlsson et al , 1977), the role of Pfn1, the ubiquitously expressed Pfn isoform, has been well demonstrated in cytoplasmic actin polymerization (Jockusch et al , 2007) and underlies its essentiality for many eukaryotic organisms (Balasubramanian et al , 1994; Verheyen and Cooley, 1994; Witke et al , 2001). This indicates a selection pressure during in vivo expansion to restore XPO6 expression or the amplification of a small fraction of tumor cells with inefficient XPO6 KO. Here, we focused on the highly selective nuclear exporter XPO6, whose only known cargo is the dimeric actin/Pfn complex (Stüven et al , 2003). Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Paradoxically, Pfn1 also shows tumor-inhibitory activities in breast, bladder, and pancreatic cancer models (Diamond et al , 2015; Wittenmayer et al , 2004; Yao et al , 2014; Zoidakis et al , 2012; Zou et al , 2007). Paradoxically, Pfn1 also shows tumor-inhibitory activities in breast, bladder, and pancreatic cancer models (Diamond et al , 2015; Wittenmayer et al , 2004; Yao et al , 2014; Zoidakis et al , 2012; Zou et al , 2007). Interestingly, our analyses suggested that XPO6 level is preferentially associated with the survival of lymph-node-positive breast cancer patients. Our prior study suggested that the anticancer activity of Pfn1 stems from its poorly understood nuclear functions that are spatially separate from its essential cytoplasmic functions (Diamond et al , 2015) and requires interaction with at least one nuclear protein containing the poly-L-proline (PLP) motif (XP ≥ 5; X = G, A, I, S, L) (Holt and Koffer, 2001). This was confirmed in vivo using orthotopically implanted MCF-7 cells. However, the growth inhibition by XPO6 knockdown in the mouse chondrocytes indicates that tolerability of XPO6 inhibition by healthy cells may depend on their tissue origins and contexts.

By discovering the interaction between Pfn1 and the SEC, we defined a molecular function of nuclear Pfn1 and linked it directly to cancer. The SEC has been extensively studied for its role in productive transcriptional elongation (He et al , 2010; Lin et al , 2010; Sobhian et al , 2010). A recent study showed that MLLT1 (encoding ENL) mutations are causally linked to Wilms tumors (Perlman et al , 2015). A recent study showed that MLLT1 (encoding ENL) mutations are causally linked to Wilms tumors (Perlman et al , 2015). ENL was recently identified as an acetyl-lysine-binding protein, joining the BET family proteins as an epigenetic reader (Wan et al , 2017). This is consistent with the finding that ENL depletion in leukemia cells inhibited Cdk9 chromatin recruitment (Wan et al , 2017). This is consistent with the finding that ENL depletion in leukemia cells inhibited Cdk9 chromatin recruitment (Wan et al , 2017). This is consistent with the finding that ENL depletion in leukemia cells inhibited Cdk9 chromatin recruitment (Wan et al , 2017). In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. Though largely unexplored in cancer, XPO6 mRNA level is a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer (Hao et al , 2016). The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes.

Primary antibodies for ChIP include rabbit anti- p-Rpb1(Ser2) (CTD) (Cell Signaling, #13499), rabbit anti-Cdk9 (Cell Signaling, #2316), rabbit anti-cyclin T1 (Cell Signaling, #81464), rabbit anti-ENL (Bethyl lab, A302-268A), rabbit anti-H3K36me3 (Cell Signaling, #4909) antibodies. Mouse anti-BrdU antibody for immunofluorescence staining (B2531) was purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence staining include rabbit anti-Pfn1 (Abcam, ab124904). Silent mutations resistant to shPFN1 #1 and #2 were introduced in human Pfn1 cDNA by QuickChange: AGC to TCG (nucleotide 253-255) and TTG to CTC (nucleotide 367-369). Oligonucleotides for four pairs of sgRNAs were synthesized, each pair consisting of two annealed oligonucleotides whose target sequences in XPO6 are ≤ 20 base pairs apart. Following oligo annealing, they were inserted into the BbsI sites of the pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro vector (PX462, Addgene 48141) (Ran et al , 2013).

Briefly, 30 μl samples were mixed with 200 μl UA buffer consisting of 8M urea (Sigma, U5128) in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and added to Microcon YM-30 filter units (Millipore, MRCF0R030). Samples were spun for 15 min at 14,000 x g and washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer by centrifugation at the same speed for the same length of time. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min, washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer, and 60 μL of sequencing-grade trypsin (Sigma, #11418025001) (200-400 ng total) in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the filter units.

For Data dependent acquisitions, mass spectra and tandem mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion and high-sensitivity mode. Advanced information-dependent acquisition (IDA) was used for MS/MS collection on the TripleTOF 5600 to obtain MS/MS spectra for the 20 most abundant parent ions following each survey MS1 scan (allowing typically for 80 ms acquisition time per each MS/MS). Search parameters were set to an initial precursor ion tolerance of 0.07 Da, MS/MS tolerance at 40 ppm and requiring strict tryptic specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C in TBS/0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Proteins were developed using the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (34075, ThermoFisher) or West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (34096, ThermoFisher), and imaged on a Gel Doc XR imaging system (Bio-Rad). For breast cancer, 86.6% of the 112 cases with adjacent normal tissues overexpress XPO6 by a median 1.36-fold (Figure 1B). Cells were permeabilized by PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, denatured by 2M HCl for 30 min and neutralized by 0.1M sodium tetraborate for 2 min. Data were analyzed by Python 3.8 for statistical significance with the Scipy, Pingouin, and Scikit Posthocs packages.

The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjust p values. Raw data had been processed through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) and provided as log2 transformed normalized values against a common pool of reference samples. For overall survival analysis of various TCGA datasets as undivided cohorts (Figures 1E and S6E) or stage-defined sub-cohorts (Figures 1F, 2A, and S6E), RNA-seq data and clinical information hosted by KM plotter were used. For all analyses, median cutoff was chosen to split cohorts evenly into subgroups with high versus low mRNA or protein levels of XPO6 and Pfn1. Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.6-p5. Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.6-p5. The TMM size factors and the matrix of counts were imported into the R/Bioconductor package Limma. Differential expression analysis was then performed to analyze for differences between shXPO6 and shLUC-infected cells expressing XPO6(WT) or XPO6(RNAi-Res), and the results were filtered for only those genes with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate adjusted p values less than or equal to 0.05.

Using Kaplan-Meier (KM) Plotter (Nagy et al , 2018), we first performed pan-cancer Kaplan-Meier analysis between XPO6 mRNA levels and overall survival (OS) using the TCGA RNA-seq data. These normalized data were loaded into the Integrated Genome Viewer (Robinson et al , 2011) and replicates for each sample were summed together. In the combined datasets, we observed nearly significant correlation (p = 0.066) between high XPO6 mRNA levels and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in lymph-node-positive, but not lymph-node-negative, patients (Figure S2E), and this was confirmed using an individual dataset (GSE21653) (Finetti et al , 2008) (Figure S2F). In addition, we observed statistically significant association between high XPO6 protein levels and worse OS of a cohort of 65 breast cancer patients (Tang et al , 2018)( Figure 1G), the only proteomic dataset available at KM Plotter for outcome analysis. Conversely, overexpressing XPO6 in MCF10A cells increased their growth (Figure 2D), supporting the positive impact of XPO6 on cell growth.To confirm that the growth phenotype of XPO6 knockdown was due to on-target effects, we stably expressed wild-type (WT) and RNA-inhibitor-resistant (RNAi-Res) XPO6 in MCF-7 cells (Figure S3C).

While shXPO6 #3 inhibited the growth of XPO6(WT) MCF-7 cells, this effect was significantly rescued by XPO6(RNAi-Res) (Figure 2E). We chose Cas9(D10A) nickase (Cas9n) to increase editing specificity and designed four pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting XPO6. BrdU labeling and DNA content analysis displayed evidence of G1/S arrest and cell-cycle inhibition, similar to XPO6 knockdown effects in MCF-7 cells (Figures S4D and S4E).

Nuclear Pfn1 is required for the growth-inhibitory effect of XPO6 lossXPO6 is a specific nuclear exporter for the Pfn/actin complex (Stüven et al , 2003). XPO6 knockdown caused no growth inhibition of Pfn1-null chondrocytes infected with an empty vector or YFP (Figures 4C and 4D). Re-expressing untagged or YFP-tagged Pfn1 restored growth inhibition by XPO6 knockdown (Figures 4C, 4D, S5G, and S5H). Re-expressing untagged or YFP-tagged Pfn1 restored growth inhibition by XPO6 knockdown (Figures 4C, 4D, S5G, and S5H). Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. While high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with better survival of stage II (Figure S6E) and lymph-node-negative (Figure S6F; p = 0.12, statistically insignificant) TCGA patients, an opposite trend was observed in the combined GEO and EGA datasets where high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with worse survival of lymph-node-negative patients (Figure S6G). XPO6 is the most recently discovered member of the exportin family and is specific to the dimeric complex of nuclear actin and profilin (Pfn) (Stüven et al , 2003). BOD1L1 is a limitedly characterized protein with a role in DNA replication fork stability (Higgs et al , 2015).
