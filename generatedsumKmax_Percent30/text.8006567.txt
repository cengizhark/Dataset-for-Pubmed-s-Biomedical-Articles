Additional evidence that sex hormones may be involved comes from the observation that castrated NOD/ShiLtJ male mice display SS-like clinical features similar to females while ovariectomized females show the opposite effect.55,56 Testosterone treatment of female mice has been shown to reduce salivary gland inflammation.57 Finally, Th17 cells from a C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 SS-like mouse model show increased proliferation only in females.58 Together, these studies indicate a potential role for sex hormones in SS that could be further explored by quantifying SPMs in castrated and ovariectomized mice. Specifically, production of these SPMs was elicited by DHA in a dose and time dependent manner. For instance, alveolar macrophages isolated from severe asthma patients show reduced LXA4 and increased LTB4 production.59 Furthermore, eosinophils derived from chronic rhinosinusitis patients had a reduced biosynthesis of 12/15-LOX-derived mediators.60 Finally, eosinophils derived from severe asthma patients showed a reduction in PD1 biosynthesis.61 Future studies to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of specific cell populations within NOD/ShiLtJ mouse SMGs as well as human minor salivary glands are warranted. In summary, there was a sex-dependent dysregulation of SPMs, their receptors as well as their biosynthetic enzymes in female but not male NOD/ShiLtJ mice after disease onset. 2.2 |Saliva collectionMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylaxine (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine), and injected with pilocarpine-HCl/PBS (Sigma) at 10 mg/kg via i.p to stimulate saliva secretion. 2.2 |Saliva collectionMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylaxine (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine), and injected with pilocarpine-HCl/PBS (Sigma) at 10 mg/kg via i.p to stimulate saliva secretion. 2.3 |Plasma collectionMice were euthanized with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Samples were held at −80°C for 1 hour to allow for protein precipitation and centrifuged. Supernatants were collected and concentrated to less than 1 mL of methanol content under nitrogen flow in an automated evaporation system (TurboVap LV, Biotage). A Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (4.6×100 mm, 2.7 micron particle size) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) guarded by a Security Guard Ultra C18 precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) were used for HPLC separation, see Table S2. After 2 minutes at 50% of solvent B (A: 0.01% acetic acid in water; B: 0.01% acetic acid in methanol), analytes were separated by a linear gradient up to 80% of solvent B over 9.0 minutes and the concentration of solvent B was maintained at 80% for 3.5 minutes. The column was subsequently washed for 5.5 minutes at 98% B and re-equilibrated with 80% of solvent A over 3.0 minutes. 2.5 |Primary SMG cell isolationBoth female and male NOD/ShiLtJ mice at 7 weeks of age (pre-disease stage) and 12 weeks post-disease stage) were euthanized with CO2 and their SMG were dissected as previously described.39 Then, glands were dissociated using a GentleMACS Tissue Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Sand Diego, CA) followed by enzymatic digestion with a commercially available mouse tumor dissociation kit (#130–096-730, Miltenyi Biotec Inc, San Diego, CA) with a subsequent filtration step using a 70 μm of cell strainer as previously described.37 Next, freshly isolated SMG cell suspensions were cultured in defined DMEM-Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium containing 2.5% of fetal bovine serum, 0.1 μM of retinoic acid, 80 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor, 2 nM of triiodothyronine, 5 mM of glutamine, 0.4 μg/mL of hydrocortisone, 5 μg/mL of insulin, 5 μg/mL of transferrin, 5 ng/mL of sodium selenite, and 50 μg/mL of gentamicin. 2.5 |Primary SMG cell isolationBoth female and male NOD/ShiLtJ mice at 7 weeks of age (pre-disease stage) and 12 weeks post-disease stage) were euthanized with CO2 and their SMG were dissected as previously described.39 Then, glands were dissociated using a GentleMACS Tissue Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Sand Diego, CA) followed by enzymatic digestion with a commercially available mouse tumor dissociation kit (#130–096-730, Miltenyi Biotec Inc, San Diego, CA) with a subsequent filtration step using a 70 μm of cell strainer as previously described.37 Next, freshly isolated SMG cell suspensions were cultured in defined DMEM-Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium containing 2.5% of fetal bovine serum, 0.1 μM of retinoic acid, 80 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor, 2 nM of triiodothyronine, 5 mM of glutamine, 0.4 μg/mL of hydrocortisone, 5 μg/mL of insulin, 5 μg/mL of transferrin, 5 ng/mL of sodium selenite, and 50 μg/mL of gentamicin.

Subsequently, membranes were blocked for 1 hour at RT using 5% of BSA in Tris-buffered saline [0.137 M NaCl, 0.025 M Tris (hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, pH 7.4] containing 0.1% of Tween-20 (TBST) and immunoblotted overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies in TBST containing 5% of BSA: mouse-anti-β-actin (Abcam; Cambridge, MA) 1:2500 dilutions, rabbit-anti-FPR2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1:1000 dilutions and rabbit anti-G protein-coupled receptor 18 (GPR18) (Abcam; Cambridge, MA) 1:1000 dilutions.

The membranes were washed three times for 5 minutes each with TBST and treated with a Bio-Rad Clarity detection reagent (Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed three times for 5 minutes each with TBST and treated with a Bio-Rad Clarity detection reagent (Bio-Rad). The only exception was RvD2, which showed an approximately 1.6-fold increase that did not reach significance thresholds (Figure 2B). The only exception was RvD2, which showed an approximately 1.6-fold increase that did not reach significance thresholds (Figure 2B). Similarly, all arachidonic acid (AA)-derived products had an approximately >40-fold increase in plasma from post-disease female mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (Figure 2A) where specific SPM levels were statistically significantly upregulated (eg, leukotriene B4 [LTB4], Prostaglandin D2 [PGD2], Prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], Figure 2B). Particularly, among the DHA-derived SPMs, PD1 was increased by approximately 6-fold in plasma from post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (not statistically different, Figure 2C). Particularly, among the DHA-derived SPMs, PD1 was increased by approximately 6-fold in plasma from post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (not statistically different, Figure 2C). Particularly, among the DHA-derived SPMs, PD1 was increased by approximately 6-fold in plasma from post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (not statistically different, Figure 2C). Particularly, among the DHA-derived SPMs, PD1 was increased by approximately 6-fold in plasma from post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (not statistically different, Figure 2C). Particularly, among the DHA-derived SPMs, PD1 was increased by approximately 6-fold in plasma from post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (not statistically different, Figure 2C). Regarding the EPA-derived SPMs, 18-HEPE demonstrated a modest 1.6-fold increase in abundance in post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts, whereas the levels of RvE1 were exhibited an approximately 10-fold reduction in post-disease male mice, (Figure 2A) however, there were no significant differences (Figure 2C). Moreover, all the AA-derived products showed only a modest increase in post-disease male mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts with LTB4 and LXB4 showing an approximately a 10-fold increase, whereas PGD2 and PGE2 demonstrated a 5-fold increase in post-disease male mice (Figure 2A) with no significant differences observed (Figure 2C). In saliva, the DHA-derived SPMs, RvD1, and RvD2 exhibited an approximately 1.5-fold increase in post-disease female mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts while additional DHA-derived SPMs were undetectable (Figure 2D). In saliva, the DHA-derived SPMs, RvD1, and RvD2 exhibited an approximately 1.5-fold increase in post-disease female mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts while additional DHA-derived SPMs were undetectable (Figure 2D). Likewise, no differences were observed in RvD2 levels at the same time points (Figure 5B,D). In males, no significant differences in the expression of these biosynthetic enzymes were observed between the post-disease and pre-disease groups (Figure 6A). Together, these results indicate that expression of SPM-biosynthetic enzymes is dysregulated in SMG of females but not male NOD/ShiLtJ mice after disease onset.
