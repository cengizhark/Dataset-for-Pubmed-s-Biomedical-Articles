In this series we used low stimulation intensities (0.05–0.3 mA) because we wanted to concentrate on modulation by quinpirole. 2B) (Bamford et al , 2004a; Bamford et al , 2004b; Bamford et al , 2008). 2B) (Bamford et al , 2004a; Bamford et al , 2004b; Bamford et al , 2008). 2B) (Bamford et al , 2004a; Bamford et al , 2004b; Bamford et al , 2008). 2B) (Bamford et al , 2004a; Bamford et al , 2004b; Bamford et al , 2008). Following dye loading, cortical re-stimulation resulted in exocytosis of FM1-43 dye from the terminals, which decreased in a manner approximated by a single exponent, characteristic of synaptic vesicle fusion (Figs. At this stimulation frequency, the mean halftime of release from corticostriatal terminals in slices from YAC128 mice was 17% lower at 1 month of age compared to WT (t1/2= 180 sec for YAC128 vs. t1/2= 211 sec for WT; Figs.

At one month, mutant huntingtin increased vesicular release from all terminals (Fig. At one month, mutant huntingtin increased vesicular release from all terminals (Fig. In 12 month-old YAC128 slices, all terminals became slower so that the faster releasing subpopulation became similar to WTs, whereas the slower population of terminals were further inhibited (Fig. The results demonstrated that age-dependent changes in corticostriatal activity are biphasic.

The halftime of release increased from t1/2= 211 sec at 1 month, to t1/2= 230 sec at 7 months, and to t1/2= 234 sec at 12 months (Figs. In YAC128 mice, terminal release kinetics also declined with age but did so to a greater extent than in WTs, decreasing from t1/2= 180 sec at 1 month, to t1/2= 243 sec at 7 months, and to t1/2= 300 sec at 12 months (Figs. At 1 month however, there was preferential excitation in those terminals with halftimes of release lower than one standard deviation below the mean.

There was a decline in the fractional release with age to f = 0.032±0.002% at 7 months and to f = 0.025±0.002% at 12 months (F(2,90)= 3; p<0.05, ANOVA).

Similar to 1 month-old WT mice, both quinpirole and amphetamine filtered corticostriatal release by selective inhibition of the slowest releasing terminals (Fig. Similar to 1 month-old WT mice, both quinpirole and amphetamine filtered corticostriatal release by selective inhibition of the slowest releasing terminals (Fig. Similar to 1 month-old WT mice, both quinpirole and amphetamine filtered corticostriatal release by selective inhibition of the slowest releasing terminals (Fig. Similar to 1 month-old WT mice, both quinpirole and amphetamine filtered corticostriatal release by selective inhibition of the slowest releasing terminals (Fig. Similar to 1 month-old WT mice, both quinpirole and amphetamine filtered corticostriatal release by selective inhibition of the slowest releasing terminals (Fig. 6D–F; p<0.05) and amphetamine (t1/2= 340 sec; p<0.01) remained inhibitory. AnimalsMice were obtained from the University of British Columbia or from the breeding colony at UCLA. In contrast, peak amplitudes of cells from YAC128 mice increased by 15.8±6.7% (p=0.0012 compared to values from WTs) and 6.5±11.6% (p=0.016 compared to values from WTs) at quinpirole concentrations of 1 and 10 μM, respectively.Although both amphetamine and quinpirole continued to inhibit release in older WT and YAC128 mice, corticostriatal filtering became impaired and the average response to D2 receptor manipulation declined with age. While dopamine’s inhibition of corticostriatal release decreased in both WT and YAC128 slices, there was a greater reduction in YAC128 mice by 12 months (Fig. Rodents exposed to behaviorally salient stimuli display a rapid pulsatile elevation of striatal dopamine that reaches 200–500 nM and declines to background levels in <1 sec (Robinson et al , 2001).

Biphasic alterations in biophysical membrane properties and postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated currentsIn order to more specifically examine postsynaptic changes in AMPAR function, we assessed changes in evoked currents in acutely dissociated MSNs at 1 and 7 months. The amplitude of the AMPA peak increased markedly in the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ; 10 μM), an inhibitor of AMPAR desensitization (Fig. The desensitization rates are slower when the FLIP version of AMPARs predominates and faster when the FLOP version predominates (Partin et al , 1994; Partin et al , 1995; Vorobjev et al , 2000). Thus, MSNs from YAC128 mice at both ages may express a higher proportion of FLIP variant compared to those of WTs.

Concentration-response functions of AMPAR-mediated currentsFinally, we determined if age-dependent alterations in glutamate release produced sensitivity changes in AMPAR-mediated responses. Concentration-response functions of AMPAR-mediated currentsFinally, we determined if age-dependent alterations in glutamate release produced sensitivity changes in AMPAR-mediated responses. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. This age-related effect led to a significant difference in response size when the comparisons were made at 7 months. At 12 months, the synaptic response amplitude in YAC128 MSNs remained depressed. Activation of extra-synaptic NMDA receptors could then activate a pro-apoptotic pathway (Papadia and Hardingham, 2007; Leveille et al , 2008), leading to a further loss of MSNs.

Brains were dissected and sliced in the coronal plane (350 μm thick) in oxygenated ice-cold low-Ca2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 glucose. We have interpreted these findings to indicate that the declines in capacitance and time constants are due to decreases in neuronal size and the extent of the dendritic field whereas the increase in input resistance is due to a loss of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Ariano et al , 2002).

Since the faster releasing terminals would induce larger amplitude postsynaptic currents (Bamford et al , 2004b) in D2-presenting MSNs (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007), persistence of these amplified responses into adulthood would provoke excitatory stress on D2-positive neurons with preferential degeneration of MSNs projecting to the globus pallidus (Reiner et al , 1988; Albin et al , 1990). The results suggest that the YAC128 mutation alters D2 receptor-dependent filtering. The results suggest that the YAC128 mutation alters D2 receptor-dependent filtering. Therefore, the number or sensitivity of presynaptic D2 receptors on glutamatergic terminals may remain stable while the releasing effect of amphetamine diminishes in senescence (Gerhardt and Maloney, 1999).

Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier in concert with Clampex acquisition software (v8.1). Such changes emphasize the importance of designing therapies that separately target different phases of the disease. Passive membrane properties of MSNs were determined in voltage clamp mode by applying a depolarizing step voltage command (10 mV) and using the membrane test function integrated in the pClamp8 software. The patch pipette (4–5 MΩ) contained the following solution (in mM): 130 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 0.5 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, 0.1 leupeptin and 4 QX-314 (pH 7.25–7.3, 280–290 mOsm). Evoked AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV in ACSF containing 10 μM bicuculline (BIC, a GABAA receptor antagonist). Coronal sections (200 μm thick) containing cortex and striatum were cut on a vibratome and allowed to recover for 1 h in carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ACSF solution: (in mM) 109 NaCl, 5 KCl, 35 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaHPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES acid and 10 glucose at room temperature. To remove adventitious tissue staining after FM1-43 loading, sections were incubated in ADVASEP-7 (CyDex, Overland Park, KS; 1 mM in ACSF) (Kay et al , 1999) for 2 min. To remove adventitious tissue staining after FM1-43 loading, sections were incubated in ADVASEP-7 (CyDex, Overland Park, KS; 1 mM in ACSF) (Kay et al , 1999) for 2 min. To stimulate dopamine release, bipolar electrodes were placed in the striatum and visualized on the edge of the region of interest (Fig. For whole cell voltage clamp recordings, the internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 175 N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 40 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 10 ethylene glycol-bis (-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 12 phosphocreatine, 2 Na2ATP, 0.2 Na2GTP, and 0.1 leupeptin (pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mOsm, Sigma Chemicals).

Solution changes were performed by changing the position of the array with a DC drive system controlled by a SF-77B perfusion system (Warner Instruments) synchronized by pClamp. Responsiveness of cells to AMPA application in the absence or presence of 10 μM cyclothiazide (CTZ) was examined at a holding potential of −70 mV. Analyses were performed with Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), Statistica 6.1 (Tulsa, OK), SigmaStat (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software suites. Group means for all measures were compared using Student’s t tests (for two group comparisons) and appropriately designed ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni t-tests (multiple group comparisons). At 1 month, the mean peak response amplitudes were significantly greater in cells from YAC128 mice compared to those of WTs at stimulation intensities between 0.3–1.0 mA (Figs.
