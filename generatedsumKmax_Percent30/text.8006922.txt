The system enables researchers to test different interventions for modulation of the microbiota diversity, composition and metabolic function that can influence diverse features of the host intestinal and overall health. The effects of many common gut microbiome modulators (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, fecal transplantation and infections) on the composition and metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota remain largely elusive. Specifically, the effect of different prebiotics on the microbiota fermentation capacity in terms of periodic changes in the gut microbiota diversity and composition, the fecal pH, and the levels of microbial metabolites including SCFAs and lactate can be studied13. 1.Preparation of the culture media, prepare nine types of stock solutionsSolution A (1,000 mL): Dissolve 5.4 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 2.7 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), 0.16 g of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O), 0.12 g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O), 0.06 g of manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O), 0.06 g of cobaltous chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), and 5.4 g of ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4, in deionized water to make total volume to 1,000 mL.Solution B (1,000 mL): Dissolve 2.7 g Potassium Hydrogen Phosphate (K2HPO4) in deionized water to make total volume to 1000 mL.Trace mineral solution (1,000 mL): Dissolve 500 mg of disodium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate dihydrate (Na2EDTA), 200 mg of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), 10 mg of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4·7H2O), 3 mg of manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O), 30 mg of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), 20 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, 1 mg of cupric chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), 2 mg of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) and 3 mg of sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) in deionized water to make total volume to 1,000 mL.NOTE: This solution is light sensitive, therefore ensure to be stored in dark/black or aluminum wrapped tubes/bottles.Water soluble vitamin solution (1,000 mL): Dissolve 100 mg of thiamine hydrochloride (Thiamin-HCl), 100 mg of D-pantothenic acid, 100 mg of Niacin, 100 mg of pyridoxine, 5 mg of P-aminobenzoic acid and 0.25 mg of Vitamin B12 in deionized water to make total volume to 1,000 mL.Folate: biotin solution (1,000 mL): Dissolve 10 mg of folic acid, 2 mg of D-biotin and 100 mg of ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) in deionized water to make total volume to 1,000 mL.Riboflavin solution (1,000 mL): Dissolve 10 mg of Riboflavin in 5 mM HEPES (1.19 g/L) solution to make total volume to 1,000 mL.Hemin solution (10 mL): Dissolve 5,000 mg of Hemin in 10 mM sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (0.4 g/L) solution to make total volume to 10 mL.Short-chain fatty acid mix (10 mL): Combine 2.5 mL of N-valerate, 2.5 mL of isovalerate, 2.5 mL of isobutyrate and 2.5 mL: DL-α-methylbutyrate.NOTE: This solution is recommended to use in fume hood to avoid smell and fumes.Resazurin (1,000 mL): Dissolve 1 g of resazurin in deionized water and make total volume to 1,000 mL. Preparation of Anaerobic Chamber and Required Material Preparation of Anaerobic Chamber and Required Material Preparation of Tubes and Fibers Preparation of Tubes and Fibers Ensure the tube temperature is 37 °C at the time of inoculation, therefore bring the tubes in the incubator enclosed within the anaerobic chamber. Anaerobic dilution solution (at least 48 h before fermentation experiment): Dissolve 5 g of NaCl, 2 g of glucose and 0.3 g of Cysteine-HCl in deionized water and make total volume to 1,000 mL. Autoclave and store it inside the anaerobic chamber at least 48 h before use.Fecal inoculum preparation (at the day of fermentation experiment): Weigh 5 g of fresh fecal sample in a 50 mL conical tube, add anaerobic dilution solution for a final volume of 50 mL (1:10 w/v) and vortex for 15 min or until completely homogenized. Filter the homogenized mixture through 4 layers of sterile cheesecloth (autoclaved) and use it immediately for inoculation in the tubes containing media. Incubate the inoculated tubes at 37 °C inside the anaerobic chamber. Briefly, thaw the snap frozen supernatants obtained in section 5 from control and treatment samples on ice and carry out all further processing steps on ice. Briefly, extract genomic DNA from approximately 200 mg of fecal slurry pellets by using a fecal DNA extraction kit13.Amplify the hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene by using the barcoded primers as per the method described elsewhere13, using the primer sequences as described in the Earth Microbiome Project protocol18.Purify the resulting amplicons with magnetic purification beads and quantify by Picogreen or an equivalent method.

Pool the purified PCR products in equal molar concentration and sequence on a sequencer13.Process the resulting sequences for de-multiplexing, quality filtering and clustering, taxonomic assignment and rarefaction, and downstream analyses by using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software as per the methods described by Caporaso et al 19. Nevertheless, it should be noted that sample preparation for these procedures may vary according to the instruments and conditions required for operation20. All subsequent experiments including sample thawing, inoculum preparation and processing should be done inside the anaerobic chamber. These metabolites contribute in gluconeogenesis and lipid biosynthesis, act as an energy source for colonocytes, and can also have health benefits including immune modulation, controlled/improved gut barrier functions, and neuromodulation23,24,25,26. Of course, besides SCFAs, the gut microbiome also produces many other important metabolites (e.g., ammonium, vitamins, histamine).
