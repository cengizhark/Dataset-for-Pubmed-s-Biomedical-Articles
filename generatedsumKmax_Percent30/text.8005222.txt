A preliminary analysis of children (Age less than 18 years old; n = 13; subjects = 480; foci = 121) is provided in supplemental material (Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 3). 3.4.Meta-analysis of self-reported distressFurther sub-analyses focused only on those studies where participants reported greater subjective experience of distress following exclusion (n = 20; subjects = 632; foci = 184) revealed similar clusters as for the full sample. 3.4.Meta-analysis of self-reported distressFurther sub-analyses focused only on those studies where participants reported greater subjective experience of distress following exclusion (n = 20; subjects = 632; foci = 184) revealed similar clusters as for the full sample. Specifically, bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex extending towards the subgenual portion of the pregenual ACC, left superior frontal gyrus, and bilaterally in the PCC. Furthermore, when depicted in conjunction with Yeo 7-Network atlas (Yeo et al , 2011), we show in Fig. Furthermore, when depicted in conjunction with Yeo 7-Network atlas (Yeo et al , 2011), we show in Fig. Furthermore, when depicted in conjunction with Yeo 7-Network atlas (Yeo et al , 2011), we show in Fig. 3.6.Cognitive terms associated activationTo provide valid reverse inference into the cognitive processes associated with the meta-analytic map for Cyberball, we performed functional decoding of the ALE results from the full sample. In their seminal study, Eisenberger et al  (2003) used a Cyberball task to investigate the neural response to social exclusion. The top 20 Neurosynth cognitive terms with the highest correlation values are listed in Supplementary Table 10 and visualized as a word cloud in Fig. The highest correlation was observed for the term social (r = 0.18). 5a) did not have peak voxels located within the boundaries of the dACC (Fig. The meta-analysis results for the full sample indicate that several brain regions distributed broadly along the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices are consistently activated during Cyberball. We also identified three additional clusters—one in the right posterior insula, a second in the right superior frontal gyrus, and a third in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. The posterior insula is implicated in mediating sensorimotor processes of exteroceptive and interoceptive information (Chang et al , 2013; Craig, 2002; Wager et al , 2004; Uddin, 2015), the inferior frontal gyrus plays a role in top-down cognitive control (Badre and Wagner, 2007), and the superior frontal gyrus which is encompassed within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex commonly implicated in social-reflective tasks such as making judgements about others (Andrews-Hanna et la., 2014). The posterior insula is implicated in mediating sensorimotor processes of exteroceptive and interoceptive information (Chang et al , 2013; Craig, 2002; Wager et al , 2004; Uddin, 2015), the inferior frontal gyrus plays a role in top-down cognitive control (Badre and Wagner, 2007), and the superior frontal gyrus which is encompassed within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex commonly implicated in social-reflective tasks such as making judgements about others (Andrews-Hanna et la., 2014).

The PCC has strong anatomical connections with ventromedial prefrontal areas, and is a core hub of the default network (Andrews-Hanna et al , 2010). The PCC has strong anatomical connections with ventromedial prefrontal areas, and is a core hub of the default network (Andrews-Hanna et al , 2010). The resulting meta-analytic functional connectivity map largely overlapped with regions of the default network (encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, PCC, inferior parietal lobule, and hippocampus) and the orbitofrontal cortex, an extended region of the default network (Uddin, Yeo, Spreng, 2019). Furthermore, our findings parallel results from seed-based connectivity showing increased connectivity between the vACC and default network brain regions during social exclusion (Bolling et al , 2011a). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). vACC) (Jankowski et al , 2018; Morese et al , 2019; Powers et al , 2013; Wagels et al , 2017). One possibility for the lack of dACC engagement might be due to the task. One possibility for the lack of dACC engagement might be due to the task. Similar findings have also been observed during third person (Beeney et al , 2011; Meyer et al , 2013) or recollected experiences of social exclusion (Kross et al , 2011). Others discuss their findings in terms of support for the ventral portion of the ACC’s involvement in indexing negative affect and the dorsal portion being involved in cognitive control (Onoda et al , 2009; Shackman et al , 2011; Wagels et al , 2017).

In contrast, more ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) as well as ventral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex were more reliably recruited across past meta-analyses (Cacioppo et al , 2013; Vijayakumar et al , 2017). 2.1Literature search and study selectionWe performed a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the neural correlates of social exclusion using Cyberball. Being bullied by peers at school, discrimination at the workplace, and rejection from a romantic partner are all experiences that can lead a person to feel the sting of social exclusion.

Significant clusters using the more conservative threshold were then used as seeds to perform a region-to-whole-brain co-activation meta-analysis (MACM; Eickhoff et al , 2011; Laird et al , 2009).2.2.2.AnalysisFive meta-analyses were performed using GingerALE: (1) full sample (53 studies, 1,817 participants); (2) traditional Cyberball design (29 studies, 1,021 participants); (3) adult samples (33 studies, 1,094 participants); (4) alternating Cyberball design (17 studies; 565 participants); and (5) studies reporting statistically significant increased self-reported distress after exclusion (20 studies; 632 participants). Sleuth (version 3.0.4, www.brainmap.org/sleuth) was used to search the BrainMap database for foci within each ALE cluster mask. The brain activation patterns and peak signal coordinates in the database are paired with associated cognitive terms (Yarkoni et al , 2011; https://neurosynth.org). The Neurosynth decoder function is an integrated feature within NeuroVault, and was used it to compute a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient between our ALE map each of the term-based z-statistics maps extracted from Neurosynth. The cognitive profile corresponding to the activation pattern from the meta-analysis was determined by identifying the most likely cognitive terms given activation in the ALE map. The cognitive profile corresponding to the activation pattern from the meta-analysis was determined by identifying the most likely cognitive terms given activation in the ALE map.

The cognitive profile corresponding to the activation pattern from the meta-analysis was determined by identifying the most likely cognitive terms given activation in the ALE map. The alternating design (n = 17, subjects = 565; foci = 170) was associated with the remaining two clusters identified in the full sample: the left vACC and right posterior insula.
