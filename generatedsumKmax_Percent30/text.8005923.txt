This study included data from our own University College London (UCL) SCZ case control sample. Overexpression of reference MCPH1 led to a significant reduction in the cell counts compared to untransfected cells across all four time points (P=0.0015, P=0.0037, P=0.0063, and P=0.00038 for the 24, 48, 72, and 96 hour time points respectively). Overexpression of reference MCPH1 led to a significant reduction in the cell counts compared to untransfected cells across all four time points (P=0.0015, P=0.0037, P=0.0063, and P=0.00038 for the 24, 48, 72, and 96 hour time points respectively). In contrast however for the rs199422124 MCPH1 variant allele (G) cell counts were lower than those for the reference MCPH1 transfected cells at the 24, 48 and 72 hour time points (P=0.046, P=0.00012, and P=0.013 respectively; Supplementary Table 2).The MCPH1 rs61749465 variant allele G led to a significant decrease in cell metabolic activity between 24 and 72 hours relative to wild type (24 hours P=0.018; 72 hours P=0.027; Supplementary Table 2). The only evidence for an impact on cell metabolic activity from over expression of the reference MCPH1 clone relative to the untransfected cells was at 72 hours (P=0.028; Supplementary Table 2). Neither the presence of the rs61749465 or rs199422124 variant alleles significantly impacted the stability of MCPH1 mRNA following actinomycin D treatment over the 24 hour time period compared with untreated cells at 0 hours (Kruskal-Wallis, rs61749465: χ2 = 10.996, df = 6, P = 0.089, n = 21; rs199422124: χ2 = 10.877, df = 6, P = 0.092, n = 21) (Data not shown). The MCPH1 gene is composed of 14 exons, which encode three BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein), C Terminus (BRCT) domains. There is no reported GWAS evidence for MCPH1 association with BPD or SCZ [Group 2011; Hou and others 2016; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics 2014], however, the association finding reported here warrants replication in a larger sample. In contrast we observed a modest increase in the cell counts for the cells transfected with the MCPH1 rs61749465 G allele clone compared to the reference clone at the final time point. In contrast we observed a modest increase in the cell counts for the cells transfected with the MCPH1 rs61749465 G allele clone compared to the reference clone at the final time point. In contrast we observed a modest increase in the cell counts for the cells transfected with the MCPH1 rs61749465 G allele clone compared to the reference clone at the final time point. Pathways analysis from the RNAseq data suggests that the variant allele of rs61749465 leads to changes in protein translation and to cell cycle control. rs61749465 is located in the conserved N-terminal BRCT1 domain of the MCPH1 protein. MCPH1 is also known as BRIT1 (BRCT-repeat inhibitor of the transcriptional repressor of human telomere reverse transcriptase, hTERT) [Jackson and others 2002]. MCPH1 is also known as BRIT1 (BRCT-repeat inhibitor of the transcriptional repressor of human telomere reverse transcriptase, hTERT) [Jackson and others 2002]. These data suggest that a common disease risk mechanism may exist at the TCF4 and MCPH1 loci. 2.1.UCL Participant samplesAll cases in our study had received a clinical diagnosis of SCZ or BPD according to the International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) and were interviewed by a psychiatrist or trained researcher using the lifetime version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version (SADS-L) schedule to confirm the diagnosis [Spitzer 1977]. Both the second and third phases (UCL2 and UCL3) included participants with BPD-II that were extracted either saliva or blood [Dedman and others 2012; Fiorentino and others 2015]The UCL control sample consisted of 1820 volunteers, 1340 of whom were interviewed with the initial clinical screening questions of the SADS-L and selected on the basis of not having a past or present personal history of any Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) defined mental disorder. Heavy drinking and a family history of SCZ, alcohol dependence or BPD, were also used as exclusion criteria for controls. The remaining 480 DNA samples were unscreened healthy British volunteers collected by the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (ECACC).All cases and controls were of UK or Irish ancestry [Datta and others 2007]. UK National Health Service multi-centre and local research ethics approvals were obtained and all subjects gave signed informed consent.

DNA was extracted from blood samples using phenol-chloroform [Pereira and others 2011] and BACC-DNA Extraction kits (Illustra Nucleon Genomic, GE Healthcare, UK). 2.7.TransfectionHEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates prior to transient transfection with MCPH1 reference sequence and with the variant alleles of rs61749465, rs199422124 using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, UK). 2.7.TransfectionHEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates prior to transient transfection with MCPH1 reference sequence and with the variant alleles of rs61749465, rs199422124 using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, UK). 2.7.TransfectionHEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates prior to transient transfection with MCPH1 reference sequence and with the variant alleles of rs61749465, rs199422124 using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, UK). 2.8.Cell metabolic activity assaysThe MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to test the metabolic activity of cells expressing clones containing the variant alleles of rs61749465 and rs199422124 compared with the reference sequence MCPH1 clone described above. Using this approach, we identified the MCPH1 (microcephalin 1) gene as having a signed log P-value (SLP) of 3.

Quantitative-PCR was used to examine the level of MCPH1 mRNA at each time point (described below). cDNA synthesis was prepared adding 1 μg of RNA preparation to 0.1 M DTT (dithiothritol), RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (recombinant RNasin, Promega, UK) and 5 μl SuperScript III RT (200 U/μL) and 5X First-Strand Buffer. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at 25°C, followed by 50 min at 50°C. 125 nucleotide single read RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq v4 sequencer (Eurofins, Germany). Adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic [Bolger and others 2014]. This was achieved by filtering genes whose expression was altered (unadjusted P < 10−4) in the RNAseq data from either the MCPH1 reference clone and/or the MCPH1 variant clones compared with the untransfected cells. The G allele variant was found to be associated with BPD (P = 0.0009) and SCZ (P = 0.0367) and with both diseases combined (P = 0.0024) (Table 1). The G allele variant was found to be associated with BPD (P = 0.0009) and SCZ (P = 0.0367) and with both diseases combined (P = 0.0024) (Table 1).
