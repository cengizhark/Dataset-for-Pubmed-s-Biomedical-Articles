This is expected if checkpoint kinases activated by replicative stress inhibit the initiation of later-firing replication origins (Santocanale and Diffley 1998; Shirahige et al  1998; Feijoo et al  2001; Luciani et al  2004; Merrick et al  2004; Syljuasen et al  2005). This is expected if checkpoint kinases activated by replicative stress inhibit the initiation of later-firing replication origins (Santocanale and Diffley 1998; Shirahige et al  1998; Feijoo et al  2001; Luciani et al  2004; Merrick et al  2004; Syljuasen et al  2005). Consistent with other reports (Woodward et al  2006; Maya-Mendoza et al  2007), we show that inhibition of checkpoint kinases also increases the initiation of dormant origins. Consistent with this, a recent report has shown that a destabilising mutation of MCM4 makes mice highly susceptible to chromosome breaks induced by aphidicolin and prone to mammary adenocarcinomas (Shima et al  2007). Consistent with this, a recent report has shown that a destabilising mutation of MCM4 makes mice highly susceptible to chromosome breaks induced by aphidicolin and prone to mammary adenocarcinomas (Shima et al  2007). Interestingly, although their short-term proliferation was normal, our partial Mcm5 knockdown cells showed a reduced long-term viability even in the absence of exogenous replication inhibitors. Mcm2-7 complexes do not exclusively co-localise with sites of DNA synthesis (Madine et al  1995; Krude et al  1996; Dimitrova et al  1999). Mcm2-7 complexes do not exclusively co-localise with sites of DNA synthesis (Madine et al  1995; Krude et al  1996; Dimitrova et al  1999). siRNA oligonucleotides (Ambion) were made to the following sequences (sense-strand):Mcm5-1i: 5'-GGAGGUAGCUGAUGAGGUGTT-3'Mcm5-2i: 5'-GGAUCUGGCCAGCUUUGAUTT-3'Chk1: 5'-AAGCAGUCGCAGUGAAGAUUG-3' (Rocha et al  2005)Control unrelated oligo was purchased from Dharmacon. Aphidicolin (Sigma), camptothecin (Sigma) and nocodazole (Sigma) were prepared as stock in DMSO, while caffeine and hydroxyurea (Sigma) were made freshly in H2O before use. Caffeine was used at 5 mM to inhibit checkpoint signalling. ImmunoblottingTo prepare chromatin samples, 106 cells washed with PBS were suspended in 2 ml cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (Dimitrova et al  1999) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After a second 5 min spin at 5000g, the resultant pellet containing chromatin-bound sample was washed with CSK buffer for three times and suspended in 100 μl Nupage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, supplemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). ImmunofluorescenceImmunostaining for total Mcm5 protein was as described (Tsao et al  2004) except fixation was performed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and blocking was with PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100. FACSBrdU-7AAD double labelling was performed as described (Ekholm-Reed et al  2004). Cells continue to synthesise DNA normally when the level of Mcm2-7 is reduced (Cortez et al  2004; Tsao et al  2004) and in Xenopus egg extracts normal replication rates are maintained when Mcm2-7 levels are reduced to ∼2 per origin (Mahbubani et al  1997; Edwards et al  2002; Oehlmann et al  2004; Woodward et al  2006). For DNA content analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide as described (Tsao et al  2004). For DNA content analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide as described (Tsao et al  2004). For clonogenic assay, cells were plated 48 h post siRNA transfection on 6 well plate in triplicate with 500 cells per well and incubated for two weeks to allow colonies to form. Various suggestions have been made for the function of the excess Mcm2-7 complexes, which include roles in DNA pumping (Laskey and Madine 2003), checkpoint activation (Cortez et al  2004; Tsao et al  2004), transcriptional regulation (Yankulov et al  1999; DaFonseca et al  2001; Fitch et al  2003) and chromatin remodeling (Burke et al  2001; Dziak et al  2003). Biotin-11-dUTP was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone BN-34; Sigma; 1:1000 dilution) and appropriate Cy3 conjugated second antibody. Track clusters were then selected for the determination of intra-cluster fork density and origin spacing by the following criteria (1) clusters consisted of single DNA fibres and not fibre bundles based on YOYO staining; (2) clusters were located in a relatively isolated area; (3) clusters contained at least four consecutive tracks; (4) each track in the cluster was no longer than the mean track length + 1 standard deviation, to minimise the risk of including clusters where termination and fusion of neighboring replicons had occurred. If artificially relieved from this checkpoint suppression by caffeine, the use of these additional ‘dormant’ origins allowed efficient replication to occur in the presence of DNA polymerase inhibitors and DNA damage. The mean fork spacing within each cluster was then derived from the measurements of the distances between the centre-points of all the tracks in each cluster. The mean fork spacing within each cluster was then derived from the measurements of the distances between the centre-points of all the tracks in each cluster. The mean fork spacing within each cluster was then derived from the measurements of the distances between the centre-points of all the tracks in each cluster.

The mean fork spacing within each cluster was then derived from the measurements of the distances between the centre-points of all the tracks in each cluster. To confirm our conclusions, we therefore used a double-labelling strategy as shown in Figure 1D. Similar results were obtained when checkpoint kinases were inhibited using the caffeine, an ATM/ATR inhibitor (Supplementary Fig S3B). We therefore used siRNAs targeting different regions of MCM5 mRNA to knock down MCM5 expression in U2OS cells. We therefore used siRNAs targeting different regions of MCM5 mRNA to knock down MCM5 expression in U2OS cells. siRNAs were titrated to find the maximum concentration that maintained normal proliferation rates. Fig 2A shows the effect of one particular MCM5 siRNA (oligo MCM5-2i) on total cell proliferation. Cells treated with 2 nM MCM5-2i had a normal cell cycle distribution and maintained normal rates of BrdU incorporation (Fig 2B). Figs 3E and 3F show that treatment of cells with MCM5-2i siRNA suppressed the ability of cells to reduce replication fork spacing when checkpoint kinases were inhibited by Chk1 siRNA or caffeine. In the absence of HU, replication rates in Mcm5 knockdown cells were similar to control cells, but after treatment with 200 μM HU for either 4 or 40 h, the Mcm5 knockdown cells replicated their DNA much slower than control cells. In the absence of HU, replication rates in Mcm5 knockdown cells were similar to control cells, but after treatment with 200 μM HU for either 4 or 40 h, the Mcm5 knockdown cells replicated their DNA much slower than control cells. One important response is the activation of checkpoint kinases (ATM, ATR, Chk1 and Chk2) that stabilize the forks, inhibit late origin firing, delay further progression through the cell cycle and promote lesion repair (Bartek et al  2004; Branzei and Foiani 2005; Lambert and Carr 2005). One important response is the activation of checkpoint kinases (ATM, ATR, Chk1 and Chk2) that stabilize the forks, inhibit late origin firing, delay further progression through the cell cycle and promote lesion repair (Bartek et al  2004; Branzei and Foiani 2005; Lambert and Carr 2005). This is consistent with the idea that Mcm5 knockdown cells experience difficulty in completing DNA synthesis in the presence of HU and so accumulate in S phase with damaged DNA.We next investigated how the Mcm5 knockdown cells behave over longer times after HU treatment (Fig 5A). Mcm5 knockdown cells showed a profound accumulation in late S and G2 when treated with low concentrations of aphidicolin or camptothecin (Fig 6A). Mcm5 knockdown cells showed a profound accumulation in late S and G2 when treated with low concentrations of aphidicolin or camptothecin (Fig 6A). Mcm5 knockdown cells showed a profound accumulation in late S and G2 when treated with low concentrations of aphidicolin or camptothecin (Fig 6A). Mcm5 knockdown cells showed a profound accumulation in late S and G2 when treated with low concentrations of aphidicolin or camptothecin (Fig 6A). Compared with control cells, Mcm5 knockdown cells also displayed higher levels of p53 activation (Fig 6B) and a decreased ability to form colonies after treatment with the inhibitors (Fig 6C,D). Compared with control cells, Mcm5 knockdown cells also displayed higher levels of p53 activation (Fig 6B) and a decreased ability to form colonies after treatment with the inhibitors (Fig 6C,D). It is therefore seems sensible for cells to licence more origins in G1 than would normally be needed as a precautionary measure should problems arise during the subsequent S phase.In animal cells, many replication origins (probably the majority, Mesner et al  2006) take the form of broad initiation zones, each representing an array of different sites where replication can initiate (DePamphilis 1999; Gilbert 2001; Machida et al  2005).
