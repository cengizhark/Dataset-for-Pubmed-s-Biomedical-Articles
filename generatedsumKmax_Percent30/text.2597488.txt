A primary action of NSF on GluR2 is to disrupt the interaction between GluR2 and PICK1 (Hanley et al , 2002). We therefore began by examining two core pathways that regulate basal AMPAR trafficking: one dependent upon the interaction between the chaperone-like protein NSF and the intracellular C-terminus of the GluR2 AMPAR subunit (Nishimune et al , 1998; Osten et al , 1998; Song et al , 1998); the other an exocytotic pathway requiring a membrane fusion event mediated by VAMP/synaptobrevin (Luscher et al , 1999). Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. Myr-pep2m also did not affect baseline responses (Fig. 6) and found that the AMPAR subunits GluR2 and 3 increased in the synaptosomal fraction (p < 0.02), whereas GluR1 subunits decreased (p < 0.01). We first found that myr-pep2m did not block the increase of PKMζ in the hippocampal slices during LTP maintenance, indicating that blocking NSF/GluR2 interactions did not prevent the induction of PKMζ synthesis (Hernandez et al , 2003; Kelly et al , 2007) (Fig. The total amount of GluR2 (surface and internal) also did not change (Fig. The total amount of GluR2 (surface and internal) also did not change (Fig. The total amount of GluR2 (surface and internal) also did not change (Fig. The total amount of GluR2 (surface and internal) also did not change (Fig. The total amount of GluR2 (surface and internal) also did not change (Fig. Indeed, PKMζ inhibitors are the only agents known to reverse established late-LTP (Ling et al , 2002; Sajikumar et al , 2005; Serrano et al , 2005; Pastalkova et al , 2006). To test for a persistent effect on maintenance, we strongly tetanized one synaptic pathway and then applied myr-pep2m 3 hr posttetanization (Fig. Myr-pep2m reversed potentiation in the tetanized pathway (p < 0.01 between baseline and 3 hr posttetanization, and between 3 and 5 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between baseline and 5 hr posttetanization), but did not affect a second, independent nontetanized pathway simultaneously recorded within each of the slices. Myr-pep2m reversed potentiation in the tetanized pathway (p < 0.01 between baseline and 3 hr posttetanization, and between 3 and 5 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between baseline and 5 hr posttetanization), but did not affect a second, independent nontetanized pathway simultaneously recorded within each of the slices. Myr-pep2m reversed potentiation in the tetanized pathway (p < 0.01 between baseline and 3 hr posttetanization, and between 3 and 5 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between baseline and 5 hr posttetanization), but did not affect a second, independent nontetanized pathway simultaneously recorded within each of the slices. Myr-pep2m reversed potentiation in the tetanized pathway (p < 0.01 between baseline and 3 hr posttetanization, and between 3 and 5 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between baseline and 5 hr posttetanization), but did not affect a second, independent nontetanized pathway simultaneously recorded within each of the slices. 4B, p < 0.001 between baseline and 5 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between 3 and 5 hr posttetanization; p < 0.0001 between myr-pep2m and scrambled myr-pep2m at 5 hr posttetanization).PKMζ-mediated late-LTP can also be “captured” by weakly stimulated synapses through the process of synaptic tagging (Frey and Morris, 1997; Sajikumar et al , 2005). Blocking NSF/GluR2-mediated AMPAR trafficking with myr-pep2m reversed persistent potentiation at both the strongly stimulated synapses and the weakly stimulated synapses that underwent synaptic tagging and capture (Supplementary Fig. In addition, because PICK1 is critical for endocytosis of AMPARs (Xia et al , 2000; Perez et al , 2001), PKMζ may act to redirect AMPARs away from endocytosis, allowing more to be available for postsynaptic insertion. Local exocytosis near the synapse by a non-VAMP/synaptobrevin-mediated process, however, below our level of detection or compensated by endocytosis elsewhere, cannot be excluded (Beretta et al , 2005). Local exocytosis near the synapse by a non-VAMP/synaptobrevin-mediated process, however, below our level of detection or compensated by endocytosis elsewhere, cannot be excluded (Beretta et al , 2005). Blocking the trafficking reversed late-LTP at either strongly tetanized synapses or at weakly tetanized synapses that had undergone synaptic tagging and capture. These findings relate late-LTP expression to other forms of synaptic plasticity, particularly in the cerebellum, where a critical role for NSF/GluR2 interactions has been observed for both synaptic depression and potentiation (Steinberg et al , 2004; Gardner et al , 2005; Kakegawa and Yuzaki, 2005; Liu and Cull-Candy, 2005). This persistent, but dynamic mechanism may allow for stable, yet flexible storage of information at synapses to be the physiological substrate of long-term memory (Pastalkova et al , 2006; Shema et al , 2007). IPs with (+) and without (−) primary precipitating antisera are shown. The maintenance mechanism of the late, protein synthesis-dependent phase of LTP is critical for the storage of long-term memory (Pastalkova et al , 2006; Shema et al , 2007).

Applications of myr-pep2m (10 μM) 30 min after the weak stimulation reversed synaptic potentiation at these latter tagged synapses, as well as at the strongly stimulated synapses (p < 0.05 for both pathways between baseline and 1 hr and between 1 and 6 hr posttetanization; p > 0.05 between baseline and 6 hr). Visualized CA1 pyramidal cells were held at –75 mV, the empirically determined reversal potential of the GABAA receptor (Ling et al , 2002). Synaptic events were evoked every 15 sec (or every 2.5 sec in Supplementary Fig. The recording pipettes had tip resistance of 2-4 MΩ and contained (in mM): 130 Cs-MeSO4, 10 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 2 Na-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, ± PKMζ (7-20 nM, 0.5-0.9 pmol/min/μl phosphotransferase activity (Ling et al , 2002)), ± peptides (100 μM, unless otherwise specified): pep2m (KRMKVAKNAQ, Tocris), scr-pep2m (VRKKNMAKQA, Pepsyn), pepNSF3 (TGKTLIARKIGTMLNAREPK, Pepsyn), pep-ΔA849-Q853 (KRMKLNINPS, Quality Control Biochemicals), pep2-EVKI (YNVYGIEEVKI, Tocris), pep2-EVKE (YNVYGIEEVKE, Quality Control Biochemicals), or Botox B (0.5 μM, List Biological Laboratories). Cs was used to block potassium currents, including GABAB responses. Only cells with an initial input resistance of > 100 MΩ, and an initial access resistance of < 20 MΩ with insignificant change (< 20%) during the course of recording were accepted for study.

Control synaptic pathways were shown to be independent by the absence of paired-pulse facilitation between the pathways, as previously described (Serrano et al , 2005).

ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation (IP) of PKMζ from hippocampal homogenates was performed as previously described (Kelly et al , 2007). For IP of PICK1, the hippocampal homogenate was incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-PICK1 antiserum (N-18, 5 μg/200 μl homogenate, Santa Cruz Biotech). Immunoblots of the immunoprecipitate were performed with the following antisera: PKCα (H-7, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotech), PKCε (E-5, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotech), PKMζ (C-terminal, 1:500) (Kelly et al , 2007), and PICK1 (2 μg/ml, Affinity BioReagents). 1), it caused only minimal rundown with test stimulation every 15 sec (Fig. PKMζ-mediated AMPAR potentiation required the activity of NSF because pep-NSF3, a peptide that inhibits the ATPase activity of NSF (Lee et al , 2002), also blocked the synaptic enhancement (Fig.
