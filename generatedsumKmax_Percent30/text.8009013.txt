Consequently, selective (radio)fluorination of electron-rich arenes with CsF/KF and [18F]TBAF is obtained under mild conditions. Taken together, our fluorination approach enables the development of fluorinated and radiofluorinated compounds that are typically difficult to access by classical SNAr or deoxyfluorination strategies, and we anticipate that the ease of our method, coupled with facile access to substrate precursors, will allow for rapid access to new aromatic 18F-labeled PET tracers of use in neurology, oncology, and other disease diagnosis applications. Despite these successes, the application of deoxyfluorination methods to radiofluorination is still limited by high reaction temperatures and an activated uronium nucleofuge that is prone to hydrolysis with electron-rich phenols.9,20 With these challenges in mind, we sought to develop a strategy that would allow for site-selective arene deoxyfluorination on electron neutral to electron-rich (hetero)aromatics under mild conditions. The vial was then sealed with a Teflon-lined septum screw cap and stirred rapidly for approximately 1 minute.

The [18F]fluoride was eluted into a 5 mL V-vial which sealed with a Teflon-lined septum screw cap with 600 μL solution of 70 μL tetrabutylammonium bicarbonate (TBAHCO3) solution (20%, w/w), 53 μL of H2O and 477 μL of MeCN.

This solution was azeotropically dried with MeCN (1 mL × 3) under a stream of Argon at 100 °C and then placed under vacuum for 3 min. DCE (300 μL), anhydrous MeCN (45–65 μL), t-BuOH(400 μL) and 25 μL of TBAHCO3 in MeCN solution (~60 mg/mL) were sequentially added to the V-vial. The reaction was then irradiated top-down with an optic fiber of an OEM diode laser (MDL-D-450, 450 nm, 3.5W after fiber coupling) (Supplementary Fig. The reaction was then irradiated top-down with an optic fiber of an OEM diode laser (MDL-D-450, 450 nm, 3.5W after fiber coupling) (Supplementary Fig. The reaction was then irradiated top-down with an optic fiber of an OEM diode laser (MDL-D-450, 450 nm, 3.5W after fiber coupling) (Supplementary Fig. The reaction was then irradiated top-down with an optic fiber of an OEM diode laser (MDL-D-450, 450 nm, 3.5W after fiber coupling) (Supplementary Fig. 3) or a A160WE Tuna Blue Kessil LED lamp (Supplementary Fig. The resulting solution was diluted and evenly mixed with MeCN (500 μL). The fraction corresponding to radiolabeled product was collected and the activity was measured (this activity was denoted by β) and the time was recorded. The decay-corrected β could be calculated from the recorded isolation time of each substrate. The decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) was obtained by dividing the decay-corrected β by α. Co-injection of the purified 18F-labeled compound with commercial or synthesized 19F standards via HPLC was used to confirm the identity of the isolated radiolabeled compound. The starting activity ([18F]TBAF), injected and collected activities, isolation time and decay corrected activity for each reaction are summarized for each substrate. The starting activity ([18F]TBAF), injected and collected activities, isolation time and decay corrected activity for each reaction are summarized for each substrate. All 18F-labeled products were analyzed according to the general HPLC conditions. Initial attempts to employ carbonate or thiocarbonate nucleofuges were met with modest success (Figure 2A; 22– 23% yields). This reaction could be performed under air or N2 without significant difference. At the outset, it was determined that 427 nm LEDs were interchangeable with 455 nm LEDs (See Supplementary Table 1), and most of the optimization was performed with 455 nm LEDs due to their higher commercial availability. Alternatively, the key species could be an activated fluoride benefiting from hydrogen bond-stabilizing interactions.33 Given the practicality and accessibility of alkali metal fluorides and tetraalkylammonium phase transfer reagents, we decided to move forward with this set of conditions.

Therefore, deoxyfluorination site selectivity appears to be influenced by differences in Ep/2, thus supporting our initial hypothesis that the more electron-rich arene possesses a greater degree of partial positive charge in the cation radical and is preferentially fluorinated. The key difference between 19F− and 18F− fluorination protocols is the change of reagent stoichiometry; in 19F fluorination, fluoride is used in excess, whereas 18F fluorination employs the radioisotope as limiting reagent. The key difference between 19F− and 18F− fluorination protocols is the change of reagent stoichiometry; in 19F fluorination, fluoride is used in excess, whereas 18F fluorination employs the radioisotope as limiting reagent. We hypothesize that the excess TBAHCO3 helps to minimize the decomposition of [18F]TBAF via Hofmann elimination and buffers the system to a basic pH, which has been shown to improve [18F]fluoride nucleophilicity.36 In the absence of TBAHCO3, a significant drop in yield was observed (entry 2). Since [18F]TBAF is usually synthesized with minimal H2O present,4 our results suggest that t-BuOH is forming beneficial adducts with [18F]TBAF30 and that excessive water mitigates 18F− nucleophilicity, which mirrors the drop in 19F-deoxyfluorination when H2O concentration increases. Thus, we were surprised to see that significant product formation (62.7% RCY) occurs after only 2 minutes and displays yield growth until 20 min (Extended Data Figure 1). Nucleofuge scope for deoxyradiofluorination beyond 4-chlorophenoxy ethers.While the 4-chlorophenoxy group is the optimal nucleofuge for our system, it is important to note that other electron-poor aryloxy groups explored earlier are also compatible with our radiofluorination method (Figure 5). A greater range of compatible carbonate and thiocarbonate leaving groups all provided [18F]2 in moderate to good RCY (24.1% to 57.1% RCYs). However, not all nucleofuges were useful leaving groups as acetate, mesylate, tosylate and methyl ether nucleofuges demonstrated minimal or unsuccessful radiofluorination. Substrate scope for CRA-SNAr with 18F.While the success of our 19F−-fluorination method appears to be substrate-dependent, greater generality is observed for radiofluorination (Figure 6) as the 18F-labeled congeners are isolated with moderate to excellent RCY. One notable highlight of our deoxyradiofluorination method is the highly efficient synthesis of ([18F]35) in excellent RCY; [18F]35 also can be easily deprotected to known radiotracer 18F-5-fluorouracil ([18F]35–1)38,39 under acidic conditions.

This result is complementary to existing routes involving spirocylic hypervalent iodoniums40 or stoichiometric aryl nickel complexes34, and enables facile production of [18F]35–1.
