To introduce the three SNPs and the single indel all together into the 5’ UTR of Hnrnph1, multi-site directed mutagenesis was performed by using the GA7546G:luc2 construct with rs221962608 SNP variant as the template (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA; Cat# 200514).

For the behavioral experiments in which multiple factors were evaluated, ANOVA was used and significant interactions were deconstructed along the relevant factor to examine main effects and group differences followed up with t-tests. All other data analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (Version 8.3.0). Positional cloning of a 114 kb interval that is necessary for reduced MA sensitivityIn backcrossing the congenic line “Line 4a” that captured a QTL for reduced MA-induced locomotor activity and contained a heterozygous introgressed region from the D2J strain that spanned 50 Mb to 60 Mb, we monitored for recombination events at rs254771403 (50,486,998 bp, mm10). In response to an acute dose of MA on Day 3, 114 kb congenic mice showed reduced locomotor activity relative to B6J (Fig.1D). In response to an acute dose of MA on Day 3, 114 kb congenic mice showed reduced locomotor activity relative to B6J (Fig.1D). In response to an acute dose of MA on Day 3, 114 kb congenic mice showed reduced locomotor activity relative to B6J (Fig.1D). Again, in response to a second dose of MA on Day 4, the 114 kb congenic mice showed reduced MA-induced locomotor activity compared to B6J wild-type littermates (Fig.1E). Again, in response to a second dose of MA on Day 4, the 114 kb congenic mice showed reduced MA-induced locomotor activity compared to B6J wild-type littermates (Fig.1E). 114 kb congenic mice showed greater sensitization to repeated doses of MA from Day 3 to Day 5 (Fig.1G), due to their initially lower level of acute-MA-induced locomotor activity on Day 3 compared to B6J wild-types. Taken together, these results indicate that 114 kb congenic mice are less sensitive to the locomotor stimulant response to MA. When accounting for non-drug locomotor activity, we again found that 114 kb congenic mice showed less acute MA-induced locomotor activity relative to B6J mice (Fig.2A), as well as after repeated exposure to MA (Fig.2B-C). After two MA injections (comparing Day 4 versus Day 3 activity), 114 kb congenic mice showed a significant decrease in locomotor sensitization early post-injection (Fig.2D). The more delayed, greater sensitization in 114 kb congenic mice during the later MA injections is likely due to their initially lower MA response which takes longer to sensitize. The more delayed, greater sensitization in 114 kb congenic mice during the later MA injections is likely due to their initially lower MA response which takes longer to sensitize. Notably, Hnrnph1 (the first protein-coding gene within the 114 kb congenic interval) was one of the top genes exhibiting differential exon usage (Table 3A), providing direct evidence at the exon level that one or more functional variants within Hnrnph1 regulates exon usage and ultimately underlies differences in MA behavior. It should also be noted that we did not identify a significant difference in gene expression or in exon usage of Rufy1 (the second protein-coding gene within the interval), thus limiting functional effects of D2J variants at the mRNA level to Hnrnph1 and further supporting the candidacy of Hnrnph1 as a quantitative trait gene underlying MA behavior (28).We previously showed that mice heterozygous for a 16-bp deletion within the first coding exon of Hnrnph1 (refer to as the H1+/− mice) were less sensitive to the stimulant, rewarding, and reinforcing properties of MA and showed a reduction in MA-induced dopamine release (28, 32). To directly compare the functional effects of inheriting the deletion versus the 114 kb congenic region on gene expression and exon usage, we identified 21 overlapping genes that were differentially expressed in the striatum between 114 kb congenic mice and H1+/− mice relative to their B6J wild-type littermates (Fig.4A), which was significantly greater than what would be expected by chance (Fisher’s exact test: p = 9.31E-23). With regard to Hnrnph1, a human candidate gene association study identified a functional intronic variant in OPRM1 (mRNA target of hnRNP H) that affected binding to hnRNP H to regulate splicing and was associated with the severity of heroin addiction (51). The GC content, secondary structure, and length of the 5’ UTR can affect translational efficiency (52, 58, 58).

The GC content, secondary structure, and length of the 5’ UTR can affect translational efficiency (52, 58, 58). Thus, the altered GC content within the 5’ UTR of Hnrnph1 in 114 kb congenic mice could inhibit translation by changing the thermal stability of secondary stem loop structure (52).

Also, a change in binding sites for RBPs to regulate translation could contribute to reduced hnRNP H protein in 114 kb congenic mice (59, 60).

The hnRNP family of RBPs act in concert to regulate RNA metabolism and gene expression of other RBPs (62). Psychostimulant use disorders (PUDs), including methamphetamine (MA) and cocaine dependence, are a serious public health concern in the United States. Supplementary Material With regard to Hnrnph1, QTL mapping in an F2 cross first identified a locus containing Hnrnph1 on chromosome 11 whereby the DBA/2J (D2J) allele was associated with reduced MA-induced locomotor activity (30). Generation of B6J.D2J 114 kb congenic miceAll procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston University (#AN-15326). The founder 114 kb congenic mouse was identified by monitoring the distal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of offspring generated via backcrossing heterozygous congenic mice from Line 4a carrying one copy of a ~11 Mb introgressed interval from the D2J strain to the background B6J strain (28). The founder 114 kb congenic mouse was identified by monitoring the distal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of offspring generated via backcrossing heterozygous congenic mice from Line 4a carrying one copy of a ~11 Mb introgressed interval from the D2J strain to the background B6J strain (28). Thus, the new remarkably smaller congenic interval was conservatively defined by a region spanning proximal rs29383600 (50,373,006 bp) and distal rs254771403 (50,486,498 bp), yielding a 114 kb interval. Methamphetamine (MA)-induced locomotor activity in 114 kb congenic miceBoth female and male littermates (56-100 days old at the start of the experiment), were phenotyped for MA-induced locomotor activity. on Days 3, 4, and 5 and were video-recorded for distance traveled over 60 min using Anymaze (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) as previously described (28). RNA samples were bioanalyzed (RIN > 8) and cDNA library was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Standard mRNA LT (100 bp paired-end reads). One notable example was the identification of a genome-wide association between FAM53B and cocaine dependence in humans (4).

For differential analysis, a linear model was used to compare gene expression between genotypes with “Cage” included as a covariate. Similar to differential analysis, for each gene, a linear model was used to detect differential exon usage between genotypes with “Cage” included as a covariate and between-technical replicate correlation was accounted for using the duplicateCorrelation(), limma function (36).

This is one of the first examples demonstrating a direct correspondence between genome-wide genetic association, functional changes in gene expression, and trait-relevant behaviors (cocaine self-administration) between rodents and humans. 30 μg of protein was heated in a 70°C water bath for 10 min before loading into a 4 – 20% Criterion TGX precast Midi protein gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat# 5671094) for SDS-PAGE followed by wet transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% milk for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies. For quantification analysis of protein expression, total protein stains were used as loading controls in normalization for immunoblotting quantification (42, 43). Cells were split every 3 to 4 days and were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.For HEK293T, cells were seeded in 6-well plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well 24 hours prior to transfection and would be about 90% confluent at the time of transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the experimental firefly luciferase construct and 0.2 μg internal pRL control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase driven by the CMV promoter (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; Cat# E2261). 24 hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were detached with 0.25% of Trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat# 25200056) and counted and re-seeded at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells per well in 96-well plate.
