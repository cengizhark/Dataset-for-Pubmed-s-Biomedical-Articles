However, Cited2−/− eyes were predominantly featured by excessive and disorganized vasculature in the developing vitreous that was positive for expression CD31 (Fig. Further mechanistic studies have provided evidence that Cited2 plays pivotal roles in these processes through its transcriptional modulator functions for HIF-1 (Yin et al , 2002; Xu et al , 2007), AP2α (Tcfap2α – Mouse Genome Informatics) signaling (Bamforth et al , 2001; Bamforth et al , 2004), Hnf4α (Qu et al , 2007) and through other, as yet unknown, mechanisms. VEGF is a direct target of HIF-1 (Liu et al , 1995; Shweiki et al , 1992) and, importantly, Cited2 has been shown to be a negative regulator for HIF-1 signaling through its competitive binding to the CH1 domain of CBP/p300 with higher affinity than does HIF-1α (Bhattacharya et al , 1999). 4I), suggesting that upregulated HIF-1 signaling as a result of Cited2 deficiency could be responsible for the elevated VEGF expression and hyaloid hypercellularity and aberrant vascularization in Cited2−/− eyes. We tested this hypothesis by introducing Le-Cre (Ashery-Padan et al , 2000) mediated lens-specific deletion of Hif1a in Cited2-deficient eyes.

In this report, we show for the first time that Cited2 deficiency results in abnormal corneal-lenticular stalk formation and vitreous hypercellularity consisting of aberrant vasculature in the developing eye. In α-TN4-1 cells, Cited2 overexpression significantly increased LE9-P0 reporter activity (Fig. However, in NMuMG cells in which Pax6 is absent, Cited2 expression had no effect on the LE9-P0 reporter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was then carried out to test whether Cited2 is physically present on the Pax6 ectoderm enhancer and the P0 promoter region using chromatin prepared from α-TN4-1 cells. The results showed that Cited2 is present on the genomic region covering the LE9 sequence and the Pax6 P0 promoter (Fig. 6Fa,b), but absent in other regions upstream of the Pax6 P0 promoter (Fig. 6E, Cited2−/−;Pax6− mouse embryos reproducibly displayed corneal-lenticular stalk formation (n=2) (Fig. These data provide direct evidence that decreased Pax6 expression is indeed responsible for the corneal-lenticular stalk formation in Cited2-deficient embryos. 7C), whereas no lacZ staining was detected in Cited2flox/flox;Le-Cre−control eyes (Fig. Cited2flox/flox mice were mated with Le-Cre+ mice to generate Cited2flox/flox;Le-Cre− and Cited2flox/flox;Le-Cre+ mice. 7K), and the latter was confirmed by immunostaining for α smooth muscle actin, which labels the pericytes that stabilize the vessels (Fig. Cited2 [Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator, with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain, 2] is one of the founding members of a family of transcriptional modulators (Shioda et al , 1997; Sun et al , 1998; Dunwoodie et al , 1998; Leung et al , 1999).

Function of Cited2 in regulating the fetal vasculatureFetal hyaloid vasculature is required to provide nutrients to various compartments of the developing eye. However, the hyaloid vasculature is a transient blood supply system in that a gradual loss followed by a nearly complete regression is achieved during postnatal ocular development in mammals (Ito and Yoshioka, 1999). However, the hyaloid vasculature is a transient blood supply system in that a gradual loss followed by a nearly complete regression is achieved during postnatal ocular development in mammals (Ito and Yoshioka, 1999). The mechanisms responsible for the fetal hyaloid vasculogenesis and subsequent regression have not been clearly defined.Our current study provides evidence that Cited2-HIF-1 genetic interaction plays an important role in this process. This competitive binding reduces hypoxia-activated transcription (Freedman et al , 2003; Bhattacharya et al , 1999). This competitive binding reduces hypoxia-activated transcription (Freedman et al , 2003; Bhattacharya et al , 1999). This competitive binding reduces hypoxia-activated transcription (Freedman et al , 2003; Bhattacharya et al , 1999). This competitive binding reduces hypoxia-activated transcription (Freedman et al , 2003; Bhattacharya et al , 1999). Therefore, as a negative regulator for HIF-1 signaling, Cited2 plays an important role in controlling the HIF-1α-mediated hypoxia response. These compound mice were then mated with Cited2+/− mice to obtain Cited2−/− embryos with and without the transgene at 14.5 dpc. Proliferation assays did not reveal any obvious changes in Cited2-deficient embryos compared with their wild-type littermate controls. Conditional deletion of both Cited2 and Hif1a might further clarify whether Cited2-HIF-1α interaction contributes to the regression of the HVS postnatally. In addition, the Le-Cre transgene driven by the Pax6 upstream ectoderm enhancer and the P0 promoter in the Cited2-null background efficiently deletes floxed Hif1a (Fig. Cited2 and AP2α physically interact to impact cardiac morphogenesis, left-right patterning and neural tube formation (Bamforth et al , 2001; Bamforth et al , 2004). We detected appreciable level of AP2α in Cited2−/− lens epithelial cells (see Fig. S4B in the supplementary material) as compared with wild-type littermate controls (see Fig. S4B in the supplementary material) as compared with wild-type littermate controls (see Fig. S4B in the supplementary material) as compared with wild-type littermate controls (see Fig. S4B in the supplementary material) as compared with wild-type littermate controls (see Fig. S4A in the supplementary material). The current study has uncovered a novel function of Cited2 in lens morphogenesis and hyaloid vascular development, and offers mechanistic views of how Cited2 functions in these processes.

Phosphorylated histone H3 immunostaining was performed with anti-phospho-H3 antibody (Cell Signaling) and the staining was visualized with Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). lacZ expression was detected by X-Gal (Roche) staining and was performed on 1% paraformaldehyde-fixed eye sections according to standard methods. TUNEL assayCryosections were collected from 10.5 dpc embryos after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for the TUNEL assay according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Chemicon). The real-time PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample on MyiQ (BioRad). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity. Another pair of primers covering the region between LE9 and the P0 promoter was chosen as a negative control (NC): (a), 5′-TCAAGGAACATCTGGCTCGC-3′ and (s), 5′-GATGGGGCTCCACCAATCCA-3′. Another pair of primers covering the region between LE9 and the P0 promoter was chosen as a negative control (NC): (a), 5′-TCAAGGAACATCTGGCTCGC-3′ and (s), 5′-GATGGGGCTCCACCAATCCA-3′. As a CBP/p300-dependent transcription factor, Cited2 functions as a negative regulator of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated signaling by competing with HIF-1α for binding to CBP/p300 (Bhattacharya et al , 1999). Cited2 expression was detected in the surface ectoderm at 9.5 dpc (Fig. Cited2 physically interacts with several nuclear receptors and transcription factors, including PPAR (Ppara – Mouse Genome Informatics) (Tien et al , 2004), Hnf4α (Qu et al , 2007), Lhx2 (Glenn and Maurer, 1999), AP2 (Tcfap2) transcription factors (Bamforth et al , 2001) and Smad2/3 (Chou et al , 2006).

The corneal-lenticular stalk was further examined by immunostaining of E-cadherin. In addition, a distinctive endothelial layer on the posterior side of the cornea developed in wild-type eyes by 15.5 dpc (see Fig. S1B in the supplementary material).
