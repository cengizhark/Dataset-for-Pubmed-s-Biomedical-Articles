In contrast, we classified patients who were currently receiving opioids, or “opioid exposed,” as those who had filled a prescription for an opioid within 6 weeks of the procedure, or whose prescription was a refill rather than a new prescription. Utilization of opioid medicationsWe followed each patient for 6 weeks following the four procedures to determine 1) the number of patients who filled a prescription for opioid medications (Appendix 2), 2) the type of opioid medication filled, 3) the number of days the opioid was prescribed, 4) the number of refills, and 5) indicators of potentially inappropriate prescription.We used generic drug names to identify prescriptions from the MarketScan files. Guidelines have been established for clinicians who care for patients suffering from chronic pain in order to curb the prescription of opioids and offer algorithms for the use of alternative analgesics.11–13 However, far less is known regarding appropriate prescribing practices following routine elective surgery.14 Inadequately managed perioperative pain causes difficulty with postoperative rehabilitation, prolonged length of stay, and may be associated with the development of chronic post-surgical pain.15–17 Despite their risks, opioids are effective at alleviating postoperative pain, and remain the standard of care for treating moderate to severe acute post-surgical pain.18 Therefore, identifying safe practices for opioid management is an important priority for all surgeons in practice. This was converted to a standard unit of comparison, Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) units, by using a morphine equivalent conversion factor per milligram.24,25 (Appendix 3)This approach allowed us to compare daily doses of opioid across prescription types and patients.24,26We identified indicators for potentially inappropriate prescribing of opioid analgesics.24,25 These indicators include (1) opioid prescriptions with at least one overlap (defined as the “days supply” for two opioid prescriptions in the postoperative period that overlap by seven days or more); (2) overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions (defined as the “days supply” for an opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions in the postoperative period that overlap by seven days or more): (3) long-acting/extended-release (LA/ER) opioid prescriptions for acute pain; and (4) high daily opioid doses, defined as a daily dosage of 100 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) or higher. The MSA describes geographical regions with a relatively high density of population at its core with adjacent communities with similar degree of social and economic factors as the core. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the effect of patient factors on whether or not an opioid prescription was filled and the receipt of an opioid refill among ‘opioid naive’ patients. The average number of days of prescription supply was longest for patients who underwent CMC arthroplasty/arthrodesis (15.4 days), compared to 10.1 days (TFR), 14.8 days (CuTR) and 12.0 days (CTR) for other procedures. We observed a linear decline in the odds of filling an opioid prescription following surgery with patient age. After adjusting for other patient characteristics, patients who had previously received opioids were more likely to receive a prescription for opioids following surgery (65.6% vs. 58.5%, p<0.001), receive longer prescriptions (23.5 days vs. 4.5 days, p<0.001), and receive refills following surgery (23.9% vs. 4.5%, p<0.001). Opioid prescriptions are less commonly filled by older individuals, and the typical length of opioid therapy prescribed is shorter and the number of refills is lower compared with younger patients. Previous studies demonstrate wide variation in analgesic prescribing practices following hand surgery procedures.27,28 Similar to our findings, Rodgers et al  reported that opioid needs were higher among patients who underwent bony-related procedures, and lower among Medicare beneficiaries.28 Although this study was conducted within a single center, the authors noted that nearly two-thirds of the pills in a single prescription went unused, which underscores the need for appropriate prescribing practices to prevent excess opioid medications reaching unintended users. Previous studies have also demonstrated that patients’ psychosocial stressors and coping skills have a significant effect on postoperative pain management.29,30 Furthermore, patients with pre-existing pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, are more likely to consume opioid analgesics following surgery.31,32 Therefore, identifying patients prior to surgery who are expected to require increased doses or prolonged courses of opioid analgesics could help providers tailor their prescribing practices more effectively toward those patients who will derive the greatest benefit with the lowest risk.33 First, this study is an analysis of administrative claims data, which lacks sufficient specificity to determine the extent of pain that patients experience following surgery or more granular patient factors that could be influencing opioid consumption. Therefore, the extent to which these alternatives influence the utilization of opioids following common hand surgery procedures cannot be discerned from this data. Given recent evidence regarding the risk of opioid use, this analysis highlights an opportunity for surgeons to include opioid use as a risk factor when for considering patients for surgery and identify strategies to curb use with alternatives whenever possible.2 Future studies that examine the provider-level factors that are associated with opioid prescribing can offer greater insight regarding areas to target educational initiatives and provide clinical guidelines for providers who commonly manage postoperative pain. Opioids are commonly prescribed following hand surgery procedures, but less potent opioid analgesics, such as codeine or tramadol, are infrequently used.
