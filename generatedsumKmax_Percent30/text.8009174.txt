Coupling of disaccharide acceptor 6 and thioglycoside donor 7a in presence of NIS-TMSOTf at 0 °C produced trisaccharide 15 (93%, Scheme 3). Zemplén debenzoylation of 15 furnished trisaccharide acceptor 4, which was obtained crystalline (CCDC No 1939745). Zemplén debenzoylation of 15 furnished trisaccharide acceptor 4, which was obtained crystalline (CCDC No 1939745). Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. In this case, the conformations of the polysaccharide chains of the two independent molecules are more likely to reflect a conformational energy minimum for the chain, then would be the case if extensive hydrogen bonding were present. That the predominant isomer contained the desired α-configuration followed from the 13C-1H coupling constant for the 13C carbon involved in the newly formed interglycosidic linkage. In most situations across carbohydrate chemistry, synthesis of the 1,2-trans-glycosidic linkage is not problematic because a participating group can be introduced into 2-positions of the glycosyl donors. One of our major targets has been a conjugate vaccine for cholera from synthetic fragments of O-SPs of Vibrio cholerae.1–3 We have modified existing approaches leading to antigenic determinants of Vibrio cholerae O1 and verified scalability of reactions involved. Intermediates to oligosaccharides in this series, up to and including the hexasaccharide have been successfully prepared on multigram scales.
