Under stressful conditions, corticoids are released from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream and subsequently enter the brain. Pairwsie comparisons showed that administration of 40 mg/kg corticosterone (High CORT) significantly reduced the number of new cells formed to ≈ 50% of Sham (BrdU, Bonferroni P < 0.0001; Ki-67, Bonferroni P < 0.001). Thymus weights increased in ADX animals, and decreased in the high CORT group compared to controls (oneway ANOVA, F2,9 = 41.2, P < 0.001; ADX, Bonferroni P < 0.001; High CORT, Bonferroni P < 0.0001). One-way ANOVA showed a highly significant difference between the groups: Brdu, F5,30 = 22.6, P < 0.001; Ki-67, F5,30 = 10.0, P < 0.001. SPIR had no effect in the thymus weights of ADX rats implanted with 30% corticosterone, but thymus weights were decreased by MIFE and by the combined treatment: MIFE, Bonferroni P = 0.03; SPIR + MIFE, P = 0.006. SPIR had no effect in the thymus weights of ADX rats implanted with 30% corticosterone, but thymus weights were decreased by MIFE and by the combined treatment: MIFE, Bonferroni P = 0.03; SPIR + MIFE, P = 0.006. Corticosterone (10 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased both BrdU and Ki-67 cell counts (one-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 8.3 and 7.1, P = 0.009 and 0.014, respectively; Bonferroni P = 0.02 in both cases). Corticosterone (10 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased both BrdU and Ki-67 cell counts (one-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 8.3 and 7.1, P = 0.009 and 0.014, respectively; Bonferroni P = 0.02 in both cases). Corticosterone (10 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased both BrdU and Ki-67 cell counts (one-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 8.3 and 7.1, P = 0.009 and 0.014, respectively; Bonferroni P = 0.02 in both cases). Corticosterone (10 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased both BrdU and Ki-67 cell counts (one-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 8.3 and 7.1, P = 0.009 and 0.014, respectively; Bonferroni P = 0.02 in both cases). Pairwise comparisons showed that ADX significantly increased proliferation of progenitors compared to intact animals, as expected (Bonferroni P < 0.001 for both BrdU and Ki-67). RU362 had similar effects: counts were reduced compared to ADX-vehicle-treated rats (P < 0.001 for both markers) but were no different from intact controls (P = 1.0 for both markers). RU362 had similar effects: counts were reduced compared to ADX-vehicle-treated rats (P < 0.001 for both markers) but were no different from intact controls (P = 1.0 for both markers). The reduction in proliferation of progenitor cells by corticoids is well documented, but we have shown that the corticoid environment subsequent to proliferation also determines survival of these newly formed cells (Wong & Herbert, 2004). The reduction in proliferation of progenitor cells by corticoids is well documented, but we have shown that the corticoid environment subsequent to proliferation also determines survival of these newly formed cells (Wong & Herbert, 2004). On the other hand, the GR antagonist MIFE did not affect proliferation. This shows that the dose of MIFE used in Experiment 2 was sufficient to antagonize the GRs. The respective roles of MR and GR were directly tested in Experiment 4. The respective roles of MR and GR were directly tested in Experiment 4. The results agreed with those of Experiment 2: MR activation down-regulates proliferation of progenitor cells. In addition, this experiment clearly shows that activation of the GRs alone is powerful enough to negatively regulate proliferation (because RU362 has a highly specific action on this receptor type). Although it is known that corticoids regulate proliferation of progenitors in the adult dentate gyrus, the roles of the two receptors in mediating this process are unclear. Our findings show indisputably that, in the antagonist experiments, inactivation of MR or GR can modulate progenitor proliferation positively. Because in all cases the results from the two methods were the same, and they correlated closely with each other, this can be confidently ruled out. Newly formed cells in the dentate gyrus have been found not to express corticoid receptors (Cameron et al, 1993). Newly formed cells in the dentate gyrus have been found not to express corticoid receptors (Cameron et al, 1993). The local environment of the progenitors determines proliferation and survival of these cells (Hastings & Gould, 2003; Seki, 2003). The local environment of the progenitors determines proliferation and survival of these cells (Hastings & Gould, 2003; Seki, 2003). The local environment of the progenitors determines proliferation and survival of these cells (Hastings & Gould, 2003; Seki, 2003). This report shows that activity of MR and GR control the first stage in the neurogenetic process, proliferation of progenitors in the dentate gyrus.

SPIR was given at a concentration of 50 mg/kg/day and a dose of 25 mg/kg/day was used for MIFE. Aldosterone was given at a dose of 250 μg/kg/day and RU362 at 1 mg/kg/day. Animals were allowed six days to recover, after which the Sham and ADX groups received daily subcutaneous injections of peanut oil while the High CORT group had corticosterone (40 mg/kg/day) for 5 days.

Animals were allowed six days to recover, after which the Sham and ADX groups received daily subcutaneous injections of peanut oil while the High CORT group had corticosterone (40 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. They were killed 24 h after the last BrdU injection with an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium intraperitoneally (Fig. Blood samples were collected within 2 min after injection and before perfusion for radioimmunoassay of plasma corticosterone. Blood samples were collected within 2 min after injection and before perfusion for radioimmunoassay of plasma corticosterone. Thymus glands were also removed and weighed.Experiment 2Thirty-six animals, divided into six groups (n = 6), were used in this experiment. Group 1 (Sham) was sham-operated and Group 2 (ADX group) was bilaterally adrenalectomised. The process of neurogenesis can be divided into three distinct phases, namely proliferation, survival and differentiation. Blood samples and thymus glands were collected before perfusion as above.Experiment 3Three groups of rats (n = 4) were adrenalectomised and implanted with a 30% corticosterone pellet (200–220 mg). The drug treatment began 24 h after surgery and lasted for 10 days. On the last 4 days of the drug treatment, animals were given a daily injection of BrdU (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.).

Tissue preparationAnimals were given an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 m KPBS (pH 7.4). Thymus glands were extracted and weighed. Thymus glands were extracted and weighed. The sections were then quenched in hydrogen peroxide and incubated overnight in monoclonal mouse anti-Ki-67 primary anti-body (Novocastra, UK; 1 : 100) with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% normal horse serum. Corticosterone radioimmunoassaysTwenty microlitres of serum was first extracted with 0.025 M phosphate gelatin buffered saline (PGB) and ethanol. Corticoids represent one of the most potent regulatory factors of progenitor proliferation so far known. The extracted corticosterone was then reconstituted in 500 μL of PGB. The extracted corticosterone was then reconstituted in 500 μL of PGB. The extracted corticosterone was then reconstituted in 500 μL of PGB. Statistical analysisData was analysed by one- or two-way ANOVA; the variances were tested for homogeneity.
