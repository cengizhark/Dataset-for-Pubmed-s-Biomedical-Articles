To determine the specific carboxyl-terminal MAGI-1 isoforms that occur in the inner ear, we conducted an isoform specific RT-PCR analysis. To determine the specific carboxyl-terminal MAGI-1 isoforms that occur in the inner ear, we conducted an isoform specific RT-PCR analysis. We found transcripts representing MAGI-1a and MAGI-1c, but not MAGI-1b, in the mouse organ of Corti (Fig. We found transcripts representing MAGI-1a and MAGI-1c, but not MAGI-1b, in the mouse organ of Corti (Fig. MAGI-1 is a stereociliary proteinOur RT-PCR analysis showed that MAGI-1 mRNA is detectable in the organ of Corti and the epithelial maculae of the vestibular system.

In addition, a recent publication identified MAGI-1 transcripts in purified zebrafish hair cells (McDermott et al , 2007). We also observed MAGI-1 immunoreactivity associated with the disappearing cochlear hair cells’ kinocilia, which is not visible in the optical section shown in Fig. We also observed MAGI-1 immunoreactivity associated with the disappearing cochlear hair cells’ kinocilia, which is not visible in the optical section shown in Fig. We also observed MAGI-1 immunoreactivity associated with the disappearing cochlear hair cells’ kinocilia, which is not visible in the optical section shown in Fig. In this study, we identified MAGI-1 as a binding partner of the stereociliary protein Cdh23. In this study, we identified MAGI-1 as a binding partner of the stereociliary protein Cdh23. For Cdh23, we demonstrated that the protein’s intracellular carboxyl-terminal region is sufficient for binding MAGI-1 and that the four most carboxyl-terminal amino acids “ITEL,” which form a class-I PDZ-binding interface (Sheng and Sala, 2001), are essential for binding to MAGI-1′s PDZ4 domain. Site one is located internally in the carboxyl-terminal region and binds to harmonin’s PDZ1, whereas the four most carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Cdh23 comprise a second binding site for harmonin, mediated by PDZ2. The internal binding site for harmonin’s PDZ1 is disrupted in the Cdh23(+68) splice variant expressed by hair cells, which spurred the hypothesis that the presumptive Cdh23-harmonin complex is regulated by alternative splicing. This means that Cdh23(+68) is able to interact either with harmonin or with MAGI-1, but not with both proteins simultaneously (Fig. We isolated MAGI-1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family (Dobrosotskaya et al , 1997) that contains 6 PDZ domains, 2 WW domains, and 1 guanylate kinase-like (GuK) domain, making it an ideal scaffold for organizing multiple proteins into a protein complex.

We tested for antibody specificity by blocking the primary antibody with peptides that cover the antigen used for the immunization.

Lanes 1–4 were probed with antibody to MAGI-1 and lanes 5–7 were probed with antibodies to the Myc and His antigen tags, respectively.

All stainings were done in parallel and images were acquired using identical settings for laser intensity and gain. Here we show that only MAGI-1, but not MAGI-2 or -3, binds via its PDZ4 domain to the carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain binding site of Cdh23(−68) and Cdh(+68). In cochlear cryosections of P4, P14, P21 and 6-week-old mice we did not detect MAGI-1 immunoreactivity outside the organ of Corti (data not shown). In cochlear cryosections of P4, P14, P21 and 6-week-old mice we did not detect MAGI-1 immunoreactivity outside the organ of Corti (data not shown). 5 × 106 transformants were selectively screened and positive colonies were tested for activation of two other reporter genes ADE2 and lacZ. The pAD-GAL4-based phagemid vectors in triple-positive yeast colonies were recovered and cDNA inserts were sequenced. The cDNA encoding for PDZ2–PDZ5 of chicken MAGI-1 was used for reversed yeast two-hybrid screen according to the same protocol. Expression VectorsAll cDNA sequences described here are mouse unless indicated otherwise. The cDNA encoding for the cytoplasmic domain of Cdh23 was PCR amplified and cloned into pHA-RK5 to generate an expression vector for HA-Cdh23-Cter. The cDNA encoding for the last 108 aa (or 104 aa, missing the last 4 aa, “ITEL”) at the carboxyl-terminus of Cdh23 was PCR amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) to generate expression vectors for Myc-Cdh23-Cend and Myc-Cdh23-Cend(-ITEL). Harmonin and MAGI2-PDZ4 (888–1056 aa), and MAGI3-PDZ4 (825–977 aa) cDNAs were amplified from mouse organ of Corti cDNA and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). Nine USH genes have been identified to date. Transfected cells were washed with PBS 24–48 h after transfection and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). To achieve the best possible sensitivity and specificity, cycle lengths for different PCR reaction sets were adjusted between 30 and 33 cycles, and annealing temperatures were adjusted between 60 and 62°C. We confirmed the MAGI-1 antibody specificity by Western blot (Fig. For blocking, we used a combination of three overlapping MAGI-1 peptides covering amino acids 1–30, 21–50, and 41–70 at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml per peptide. The antibody was preincubated in these peptides for 2 h prior to immunodetection. After primary antibody staining, the samples were washed twice with PBT1 for 10 min and twice with PBT2 (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 5 min, and incubated with 7.5 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBT2 for 2 h, followed by two 5 min PBT2 washes. MAGI-1 occurs in three splice variants MAGI-1a, 1b, and 1c, which have different carboxyl termini (Dobrosotskaya et al , 1997). These experiments show that the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of Cdh23 and MAGI-1 happens via MAGI-1′s PDZ4 domain and that MAGI-1-PDZ4 is both sufficient and essential for this interaction. Our results further confirm that the interaction is independent of exon 68, and that all three MAGI-1 splice variants are potential interaction partners of Cdh23 because they all share identical PDZ4 domains.We next sought to identify the region of Cdh23 that is essential for binding of MAGI-1. When we truncated Cdh23 directly after exon 68, binding to MAGI-1-PDZ4 was abolished (Fig. We consequently conclude that the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Cdh23 are essential for binding to MAGI-1. This possibility was further supported by a study that showed binding of MAGI-1, -2, and -3 PDZ4 domains to the Notch ligand Delta (Wright et al , 2004). This possibility was further supported by a study that showed binding of MAGI-1, -2, and -3 PDZ4 domains to the Notch ligand Delta (Wright et al , 2004). This possibility was further supported by a study that showed binding of MAGI-1, -2, and -3 PDZ4 domains to the Notch ligand Delta (Wright et al , 2004). We conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments with myc epitope-tagged PDZ4 domains of MAGI-1, -2, and -3 in conjunction with HA epitope-tagged Cdh23 carboxyl-terminus.
