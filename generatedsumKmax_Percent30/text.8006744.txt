Wnt signaling pathway is initialed by binding of Wnt ligands to frizzled receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) co-receptors, cytoplasmic β-catenin is hypophosphorylated, stabilized, and translocated into the nucleus where it binds to transcription factors to direct target gene expression[21]. In this study, we have demonstrated a novel and pivotal role of LPCAT3 in adipocyte PC remodeling and provide evidence that polyunsaturated phospholipids, PC in particular, are involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby influencing pre-adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis. Our conclusions are based on the following observations: 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte Lpcat3 knockdown leads to 1) less polyunsaturated PCs in the cells; 2) less lipid droplet formation and less lipid accumulation in the adipocytes; 3) more activation of factors in Wnt/β-catenin pathway; and 4) more suppression of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated lipogenesis. One of the key finding in current study is LPCAT3 is also a major isoform in the adipose tissue. Based on our previous work, we have already known LPCAT3, a major isoform in the small intestine and liver, plays an important role in the membrane structure and function of enterocytes and hepatocytes [12, 13]. The differentiation and the establishment adipocyte phenotype are characterized by the appearance of early, intermediaten and late markers and accumulation of triglycerides [26]. The decreased triglyceride accumulation in LPCAT3 knockdown adipocyte compared with the controls indicates that LPCAT3 deficiency inhibited adipocyte differentiation (Fig. The decreased triglyceride accumulation in LPCAT3 knockdown adipocyte compared with the controls indicates that LPCAT3 deficiency inhibited adipocyte differentiation (Fig. The decreased triglyceride accumulation in LPCAT3 knockdown adipocyte compared with the controls indicates that LPCAT3 deficiency inhibited adipocyte differentiation (Fig. We found that Lpcat3 deficiency reduces SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 levels, resulting less accumulation of free fatty acid, triglyceride and cholesterol in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In mammalian cells, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) are the main regulators of adipogenesis and have been shown to have a broad overlap in their downstream targets [32]. Identifying key factors that control adipocyte differentiation is important for understanding adipose tissue biology and pathology. In searching of mechanism involved in LPCAT3 deficiency-mediated adipogenesis reduction, we have another key finding of this study. Wnt ligands can bind to low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) co-receptors and frizzled receptors.

Finally, puromycin resistant stable LPCAT3 knockdown cells and control cells were collected. On day 7, culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin and 10% FBS, and cultured for two days. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The Reaction was maintained for 5 minutes at room temperature and stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The organic phase was air dried and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) as the solvent. Lipids in each sample were then re-dissolved in 40μL chloroform containing 2% Triton-X100. After twice wash with PBS and once balance with 60% isopropanol, cells were immersed in Oil Red-O suspension for 20 minutes. Size area of lipid droplets in pictures was quantified by Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA followed by Quantitative real-time PCR performed on a Bio-Rad CFX manager version 3.1. The composition of polyunsaturated PCs in the plasma membrane is regulated by LPCATs [9–11]. After washed by TBST for at least three times filters were again incubated with species-specific secondary antibody such as goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG for 3 hours at room temperature. lipid extract from 3T3L1 adipocytes was separated on chromatography by a pre-column of Phenomenex C18, 4×20mm and a column of Waters XBridge Peptide BEH C18 3.5μm, 2.1×100mm by a gradient elution with mobile phase A(10 mM ammonium acetate +0.1% formic acid water) and B(10 mM ammonium acetate + 0.1%formic acid + 49.95%acetonitrile + 49.95%isopropanol). lipid extract from 3T3L1 adipocytes was separated on chromatography by a pre-column of Phenomenex C18, 4×20mm and a column of Waters XBridge Peptide BEH C18 3.5μm, 2.1×100mm by a gradient elution with mobile phase A(10 mM ammonium acetate +0.1% formic acid water) and B(10 mM ammonium acetate + 0.1%formic acid + 49.95%acetonitrile + 49.95%isopropanol).
