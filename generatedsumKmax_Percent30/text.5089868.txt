Notably, TCR Tg mice have been generated for the P. yoelii CD8 T cell determinant [27]. Notably, TCR Tg mice have been generated for the P. yoelii CD8 T cell determinant [27]. Plasmodium-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells have also been generated, but the MHC class II-restricted TCR is specific for a blood stage antigen (MSP-1) and the epitope is only expressed by P. chabaudi rodent parasites [28–30]. More recently, Heath and colleagues developed a new TCR Tg mouse line bearing CD8 T cells responsive to an antigen expressed during both blood and liver stage [31]. It is well known that CS-specific CD8 T cell populations can be sufficient to limit or stop the progression of liver stage Plasmodium parasites [17,26,27,33,34]. Indeed, more than 80% of CD8 T cells induced by radiation attenuated sporozoite (RAS) vaccination of BALB/c mice are responding to nonCS antigens [15] (Fig. (2) endogenous T cell responses can be studied without knowledge of specific Plasmodium antigens/epitopes or MHC class I or MHC class II restriction elements; and (3) any combination of inbred or outbred mouse strains and Plasmodium parasite species can be studied. These approaches also allow for longitudinal analyses of T cell responses through analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and thus permit characterization of T cell responses in individual mice over time prior to parasite challenge studies. Of note, methods for immunizing rodents with live attenuated Plasmodium parasite vaccine platforms have been previously covered [46,47], so our chapter will only describe methods for examining T cell responses induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination. 2.2 Reagents2.2.1 Isolation and staining of lymphocytes from peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues and liverComplete RPMI-1640 medium: 500 mL of RMPI-1640, 50 mL heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 mg/mL gentamicin sulfate, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. 2.2 Reagents2.2.1 Isolation and staining of lymphocytes from peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues and liverComplete RPMI-1640 medium: 500 mL of RMPI-1640, 50 mL heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 mg/mL gentamicin sulfate, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin.
