We found that both antibodies recognized a protein(s) in untreated and LPS treated cell extracts that is involved in complexes on region I (data not shown) and II (Fig. Antibody C138 caused a supershift of bands a, b and c (band e in lanes 22 and 27, Fig. Antibody C138 caused a supershift of bands a, b and c (band e in lanes 22 and 27, Fig. Antibody C138 caused a supershift of bands a, b and c (band e in lanes 22 and 27, Fig. 3A) and of band d (band e in lane 17, Fig. 3A) and of band d (band e in lane 17, Fig. 1C), entirely consistent with differences in levels of Defensin reported in-vivo for the two insects (Lowenberger et al , 1999; Vizioli et al , 2001). 1C), entirely consistent with differences in levels of Defensin reported in-vivo for the two insects (Lowenberger et al , 1999; Vizioli et al , 2001). Data for AgDef1 confirm the conservation of a functional unit since regions II and III have been implicated in promoter activity (Barillas-Mury et al , 1996 and this paper) and activity is further increased by the addition of region I. Data for AgDef1 confirm the conservation of a functional unit since regions II and III have been implicated in promoter activity (Barillas-Mury et al , 1996 and this paper) and activity is further increased by the addition of region I. Through EMSA we have shown that AaDefA1 regions I and II bind NF-κB/Rel-type proteins. aegypti Defensin A (AaDefA) upstream sequences (Cho et al , 1997; Eggleston et al , 2000) and the most proximal site in each promoter shown to specifically bind transcription factors in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA, Barillas-Mury et al , 1996; Shin et al , 2002). Members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors are known to mediate the transcriptional induction of numerous genes in mammalian immune and inflammatory reactions and C/EBP binding motifs have also been identified in a number of these (Betts et al , 1993; Diamond et al , 2000). First, we note that our mutagenesis studies identify a degree of plasticity in the C/EBP consensus, with functional sites having two mismatches but only one at nucleotides 1,5,7 or 8, shown to exhibit the highest conservation (matinspector). First, we note that our mutagenesis studies identify a degree of plasticity in the C/EBP consensus, with functional sites having two mismatches but only one at nucleotides 1,5,7 or 8, shown to exhibit the highest conservation (matinspector). The C/EBP group of transcription factors form dimers via their conserved b-zip domain, causing conformation changes that allow DNA binding. The C/EBP group of transcription factors form dimers via their conserved b-zip domain, causing conformation changes that allow DNA binding. The C/EBP group of transcription factors form dimers via their conserved b-zip domain, causing conformation changes that allow DNA binding. It is not known if such heteromers bind DNA via adjacent, overlapping or novel sites, or whether only one of the subunits binds DNA. Overlapping binding sites for NF-κB and C/EBP have been identified in an acute-phase response element in the angiotensinogen promoter (Brasier et al , 1990). Stein et al  (1993) reported interactions between several different Rel and C/EBP family members, further supporting the hypothesis that interactions between these two groups of transcription factors are of relevance in the regulation of immune genes. We can therefore speculate that mosquito NF-κB and C/EBP proteins might be able to interact in a variety of ways, possibly dependant on their relative abundances. GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) was used according to manufacturers instructions with nested primers (5′-CCGGTTCCTGTGGGTAGGCACTAGTAAT-3′ and 5′-GGTTTCCTCCGGCAGTTCATCGAAAAGA-3′). PCR products, cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen), were sequenced prior to transfer into the luciferase expression vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Southampton, UK). The Actin 5C-Renilla transfection control plasmid contains the Drosophila Actin 5C promoter (Pinkerton et al , 2000) in pRL-null (Promega). 20 ng template DNA was used with 125 ng of each HPLC purified primer (Invitrogen).

Actin 5C-Renilla transfection control plasmid was adjusted for sets of experiments (10–100 ng) such that Renilla activities were not less than 1% of firefly luciferase activities. Dual-luciferase reporter assaysFirefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo system (Promega). Briefly, cells were lysed in 24 well plates with 75 μl PBS and 75 μl luciferase reagent and transferred to a white 96 well plate to measure firefly luciferase activity. Aag2 cells were treated with 100 mg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 16 h prior to extraction for LPS treated extracts. For supershifts, 1 μl of antibody was added to nuclear extracts and incubated for 20 min on ice prior to addition of labelled oligonucleotide. In Drosophila the involvement of Rel signal transduction pathways has been demonstrated for all seven AMPs (Engstrom, 1999). Two 17 base pair repeats in the Diptericin promoter harbour NF-κB binding sites which act in synergy following induction (Kappler et al , 1993). However transcription factor binding to mosquito AMP gene promoters has so far only been demonstrated for NF-κB in Defensin genes (Barillas-Mury et al , 1996; Shin et al , 2002). We previously isolated an AgDef1 genomic clone and here we isolated two AaDefA genes. aegypti Defensin sequences were isolated from genomic clones of the Liverpool strain.

Analysis of proximal promoter sequences (−200 to −1) identified a TATA box (TATAA) and three putative NF-κB binding sequences (insect consensus GGGRNTYYYY, Kappler et al , 1993), all highly conserved between the two genes. gambiae (Christophides et al , 2002; Eggleston et al , 2000; Richman et al , 1996) and Ae. 5B).Sets of 5′ nested deletions were constructed to investigate the importance of putative transcription factor binding sites within the promoters. 5B).Sets of 5′ nested deletions were constructed to investigate the importance of putative transcription factor binding sites within the promoters. Very similar patterns of up-regulation were obtained following the treatment of all transfections with either heat killed bacteria (Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus) or peptidoglycan (data not shown). aegypti (Chalk et al , 1995; Cho et al , 1997; Lowenberger et al , 1995). aegypti (Chalk et al , 1995; Cho et al , 1997; Lowenberger et al , 1995).
