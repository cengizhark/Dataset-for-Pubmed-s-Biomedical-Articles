Optical coherence tomography can help characterize anterior segment anatomy and pathology, information that may be applied clinically for a variety of applications. Structural measurements of the optic nerve head, retinal nerve fiber layer, and ganglion cell layer are quantitative metrics associated with glaucomatous damage.11–13 Newer systems evaluate the anterior segment and angle structures to provide prognostic information on intraocular pressure changes with surgical intervention3 and insight into aqueous outflow pathways.14–17 Additionally, OCT provides structural and anatomical information that may lead to earlier detection of glaucoma, as well as monitoring progression over time.18 While early systems provided basic evaluation of retinal morphology,19 more advanced technology with rapid imaging and higher resolution provide detailed representations of the retina, choroid, and vitreous microstructures. Beyond advances in resolution and scan speed, additional imaging modalities using OCT technology have been developed and are starting to arrive in clinical practice. The research group of Joel Schuman, MD, was the first (to our knowledge) to evaluate blood oxygen saturation using OCT spectroscopy.27 However, the near-infrared spectrum yields low signal-to-noise ratios and is not optimal for these measurements. Applying the principles of spectroscopy and known absorption properties of hemoglobin, Schuman discussed using visible-light OCT to evaluate with very high resolution the oxygen saturation of the various layers of the eye attributable to the known absorption spectrum of hemoglobin.28 Used in conjunction with other technologies, such as OCTA or AO-SLO, structure and function can be evaluated simultaneously with visible-light OCT, providing powerful new insights into the pathology of eye disease.28,29 Michael Abramoff, MD, PhD, described using OCT and artificial intelligence to anticipate visual fields in glaucoma and aid in diagnosis.33 Felipe Medeiros, MD, PhD, discussed use of artificial intelligence segmentation of anterior segment OCT images and showing improved grading reproducibility compared with manual segmentation. Clinical validation of the accuracy of OCTA, for instance, has come from other imaging modalities, such as fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, as well as histology, although histology is not devoid of artifact and can be challenging to interpret in some structures (eg, the choroid).37 Applications that span multiple imaging modalities pose additional challenges with respect to resolution and fidelity between modalities.

Further clinical validation of measurement accuracy for OCT technologies can come from comparisons with other planar imaging modalities and known dimensions of intraocular implants, which can serve as intraocular rulers to provide gold standard measurements. Malvina Eydelman, MD, director of the Office of Ophthalmic, Anesthesia, Respiratory, ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat), and Dental Devices in the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality at the FDA remarked that “proactively working with stakeholders in the medical device ecosystem to solve both shared problems and problems unique to others allows [the FDA] to serve the American public better and to achieve our vision [to] collaborate to address critical public health needs and bridge scientific gaps, thereby stimulating innovation in the products we regulate.” The goal of the workshop was to bring together stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers, industry members, and the FDA, to discuss approaches to shorten the time from medical device conception to market release, stimulate innovation, and ensure that patients in the US are the first in the world to have access to high-quality, safe, and effective medical devices. Beyond the issues of accuracy and precision, Yasmin Bradfield, MD, highlighted the importance of understanding normal variance across age, race, and sex, in addition to the environmental variance attributable to lighting conditions (which affect pupil dilation) and device variance from differences in both hardware and software, which has been shown in early reproducibility studies.41,42 Validation of the measurements can be achieved with alternate imaging modalities, such as ultrasound biomicroscopy43 and histopathology.44 They both noted the challenge of obtaining increased reimbursements for advances in imaging, since the drivers for reimbursement are primarily physician effort and materials consumed—neither of which are increased directly by these new technologies. Adaptive optics is a technique for dynamic sensing and correction of the optical aberrations in an individual’s eye (as well as those that arise in an imaging system itself).

Alfredo Dubra, PhD, highlighted that AO is essentially an agnostic technology, because it can be applied to a variety of imaging modalities to improve transverse resolution, yielding vast improvements in the resolution of microscopic structures, such as parafoveal cones, and possibly providing more insight into subtle clinical findings associated with disease diagnosis and progression. For example, the ANSI standard assumes aberrations will limit the retinal spot size to 30 μm, while AO systems regularly achieve spots sizes less than 5 μm. Optical coherence tomography is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease because of its ability to help clinicians visualize the layers of ocular tissue, particularly the retina, in a cross-sectional, depth-resolved manner. The AO session panel agreed that further work is needed to develop clear safety standards for AO technology.
