Chronic placental ischemia was shown to increase blood pressure and induce the production of reactive oxygen species in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of pre-eclampsia. Reactive oxygen species are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and may arise from various sources such as mitochondrial electron transport, and oxidative enzymes.7 Reactive oxygen species are particularly important in innate immunity and are produced by activated neutrophils as defense mechanisms against extracellular pathogens. TGFβ is required for the expression of RORγ expression in naïve T-cells. TGFβ is required for the expression of RORγ expression in naïve T-cells. 9 IL-17A and IL-17F act in a feedback loop for activation and expansion of TH17 cells and are key cytokines responsible for proliferation, recruitment, activation, and migration of neutrophils.2, 10, 11 IL-17 stimulates the production of other cytokines by neutrophils for cell to cell communication, and more importantly, it stimulates these cells to release antimicrobial substances, such as reactive oxygen species. 13 Low-grade inflammation is established as a mechanism involved in the progression of cardiovascular disease through increased adhesion molecules and cytokine production.14 During inflammation, leukocyte numbers in the vascular wall greatly increases due to migration and proliferation.13 This leads to oxidative stress and increased inflammation, causing impaired vascular function.2 The inflammatory state leads to endothelial cell barrier dysfunction which results in increase vascular permeability.15 Hyperpermeability triggered by vascular and tissue inflammation or ischemia promotes edema, exacerbates disease progression, and impairs recovery.16 Development of atherosclerotic plaques is associated with immune cell invasion of vessel walls. Moreover, fibroid necrosis and intravascular thrombus formation are observed in small vessel vasculitis; and concentric stenosis, vascular muscular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and lipid deposition are all involved in transplant vascular disease which is largely mediated by immune cells releasing oxidative molecules that cause tissue damage.IL-17 has been linked to oxidative stress and has been shown to induce expression of cytokines in non-immune cells, including endothelial cells.11, 17, 18 Studies in mice show that Angiotensin II (Ang-II) induced-hypertension is dependent on IL-17 signaling. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) decreased TH17 cells and disease severity in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, further establishing a role for angiotensin in IL-17 production.13, 18Angiotensin may mediate IL-17 production through aldosterone, a downstream effector of the Ang II pathway.13, 19 Antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, have a role in mediating the differentiation of T effector cells. This then causes the placenta to release proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, leading to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction of the maternal vasculature, and elevated blood pressure associated with a decline in renal function, the second phase of pre-eclampsia. This then causes the placenta to release proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, leading to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction of the maternal vasculature, and elevated blood pressure associated with a decline in renal function, the second phase of pre-eclampsia. To determine if increased IL-17 is pathophysiologically relevant in PE, Dhillon et al  examined the effect of IL-17 infusion on blood pressure via mediation by oxidative stress and production of the angiotensin II type I receptor autoantibody (AT1-AA).36 In this study, IL-17 infusion into normal pregnant rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), increased oxidative stress as measured by urinary isoprostane and NADPH-stimulated placental reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in the population of circulating TH17 cells, and production of AT1-AA. Finally, administration of the superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol, attenuated the increase in blood pressure, decreased placental production of ROS, and significantly decreased circulating AT1-AAs produced in response to IL-17 infusion.36 The effect of tempol on IL-17 induced pathophysiology suggests that the ROS stimulated by TH17 cells, via IL-17, may be an important signaling molecule for the activation of B cells to produce AT1-AAs. This data suggests that IL-17 causes pathophysiology associated with pre-eclampsia, including hypertension, via placental oxidative stress and activation of the AT1 receptor.The endothelin pathway was also investigated as a mechanism by which IL-17 mediates hypertension in response to placental ischemia. The only effective treatment for abatement of maternal symptoms is delivery of the placenta and fetus. This same study recapitulated the increased IL-6 and TNF-α previously seen in the RUPP model and also demonstrated a significant increase in plasma IL-17.42 This data further confirms the appropriateness of using the RUPP model to study pre-eclampsia, by duplicating characteristics of the clinical disease in an animal model.Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from RUPPS into NP rats induced hypertension and increases in TNFα and sFlt-1, similar to that seen in RUPP rats.42 Other studies demonstrate that adoptive transfer of RUPP CD4+ T cells into NP rats induced AT1-AA production and activation of the endothelin- 1 system. In early pregnancy, the placenta is initially characterized as a hypoxic environment. To support a proposed role for IL-17 in oxidative stress mediated pathophysiology in pregnancy, we performed studies to examine the effect of IL-17 blockade on various pathways activated in the RUPP rat model of pre-eclampsia. As the placenta matures, vascularization develops, changing the placenta into an oxygen-rich environment, and the enhancement of the antioxidant systems during pregnancy act as effective compensation against oxidative stress (OS).3 In contrast to normal pregnancy, women with pre-eclampsia display increased OS and decreased antioxidants, characterized by increased circulating and tissue levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).3
