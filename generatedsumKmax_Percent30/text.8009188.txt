At the lower catalyst loading, a relatively high turnover number (TON) of 3680 was achieved. At the lower catalyst loading, a relatively high turnover number (TON) of 3680 was achieved. At the lower catalyst loading, a relatively high turnover number (TON) of 3680 was achieved. This TON is more than 42-times higher than that obtained for the pyridine(diimine) iron-catalyzed [2+2]-cycloaddition of unactivated α-olefins,2,31 and on the same order as TONs achieved with the Cp2ZrCl2/MAO-catalyzed dimerization of 1-hexene.6 Hydrogenation was conducted with PtO2 under mild conditions (ambient temperature, 50 psi H2) using acetic acid as a heterogeneous co-solvent. The cyclobutane ring in DPC imparts greater strain energy (~26 kcal for cyclobutane vs. ~10 kcal for cyclooctane), 35,36 which should increase the gravimetric NHOC of DPC by ~1.1% compared to DMCO. This higher density is a result of having more carbon atoms constrained within the ring system. The proposed catalytic cycle proceeds through coordination of two equivalents of isoprene followed by oxidative cyclization, rearrangement, and reductive elimination.32 In situ activation protocols were reported that allowed the dimerization to be conducted using low loadings of bench-stable iron (II) halide precatalysts.

In addition to an upper limit on freezing point, the specification for Jet-A/F-24 has a strict flashpoint requirement (>38 °C). To explore the potential of DMCO as an alternative jet fuel blendstock, this paper reports the preparative-scale synthesis of DMCO and describes key fuel properties of DMCO and blends with a common synthetic paraffinic kerosene. Addition of only 20% DMCO yields a fuel blend with a density close to that required for the Jet-A/F-24 specifications, while the 30–50% DMCO blends meet the density requirement.

Addition of only 20% DMCO yields a fuel blend with a density close to that required for the Jet-A/F-24 specifications, while the 30–50% DMCO blends meet the density requirement. All of the fuels, including pure HEFA, have kinematic viscosities at −20 °C well within the specification for Jet-A/F-24. The impact on the gravimetric NHOC of HEFA is modest due to the similarities in NHOC between the two blendstocks. DMCO has a higher gravimetric and volumetric NHOC compared to conventional jet fuel, along with higher density and lower viscosity. Improved catalyst stability and a transition to robust heterogeneous systems for the [4+4]-cycloaddition step are expected to further enhance the already impressive TONs achieved by the first-generation homogeneous system described here. These tractable challenges can likely be addressed by ligand design and immobilization of the catalysts on solid supports to enable development of a viable commercial process.

Proton-decoupled 13C{1H} NMR, 13C{1H} APT NMR, and quantitative q13C{1H} NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance III 500 instrument operating at 125.86 MHz. NMR spectra were processed using the MestReNova or TopSpin software suites.Analytical gas chromatography was performed using a Shimadzu GC-2010 instrument equipped with a Shimadzu AOC-20s autosampler. For samples analyzed on a Shimadzu SHRXI-5MS achiral stationary phase capillary column (15 m × 250 μm), the instrument was set to an injection volume of 1.0 μL, an inlet split ratio of 20:1, and inlet and detector temperatures of 250 °C and 275 °C, respectively. Isoprene is a particularly intriguing substrate due to the ability to readily generate it, or precursor molecules, from biomass sources through fermentation with metabolically engineered microorganisms. The GC-MS system was equipped with an RTX-5MS 30-meter column and the analysis was conducted under the following conditions: inlet temperature, 250 °C; initial column temperature, 40 °C; temperature ramp, 4 °C/min to 100 °C; 2nd temperature ramp, 20 °C/min to 300 °C.Net heat of combustion (NHOC) measurements were conducted by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) using ASTM D240N.

Maintaining a controlled temperature throughout the course of the reaction is necessary to prevent dangerous pressure build-up. ]Procedure A (200 mmol scale):The dimerization of isoprene was conducted on a 200 mmol scale as depicted in Scheme 2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MeMgCl (3 M in THF, 0.080 mL, 0.24 mmol, 0.12 mol%). The reaction flask was covered with a vacuum-dried virgin rubber septum or an oven-dried ground-glass stopper.

The reaction flask was covered with a vacuum-dried virgin rubber septum or an oven-dried ground-glass stopper. After 20 h, or upon complete consumption of isoprene, the reaction flask was removed from the glovebox and opened to air in a fume-hood. Spectral data were consistent with values reported previously.32,34 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.44–5.15 (m, 2H, (=CH-)), 2.34 (s, 4H, CH2), 2.32–2.24 (m, 4H, CH2), 1.70 (s, 6H, 1,6-DMCOD, CH3), 1.68 (s, 6H, 1,5-DMCOD, CH3). GC (30TO60TO100_20MIN): Rt = 14.0 min for both 1,6- and 1,5-DMCODProcedure B (2 mol scale):The dimerization of isoprene was conducted on the 2 mol scale as depicted in Scheme 3. In a glovebox, an oven-dried 500-mL round-bottom Schlenk flask was charged with [(MePI)FeCl(μ-Cl)]2 (0.175 g, 0.25 mmol dimer, 0.50 mmol [Fe], 0.025 mol% [Fe]), an oven-dried football-shaped stir bar, and isoprene (10 g, 0.15 mol). The Schlenk flask side-arm was fit with a gas-inlet hose, and the hose was evacuated and back-filled with argon three times before the stopcock was opened, placing the flask under a positive pressure of argon. The vessel was then removed from the hydrogenation apparatus and quickly put under nitrogen. The filtrate was transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel and washed with DI water (300 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (300 mL), and lastly additional DI water (300 mL).
