After analysis of GSK2033 specificity, we found that GSK2033 was quite promiscuous and targeted a number of nuclear receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, pregnane X receptor, farnesoid X receptor, among others that are expressed in the liver that could clearly alter metabolic gene expression profiles in the tissue. Pharmacokinetic studiesPharmacokinetic studies were performed as previously described [24,26]. Animals and preparation of tissue samples21-week old male C57BL6 DIO mice were purchased from Jackson Labs. For mouse tissue, Gapdh was used as the reference gene. Fifty μg/ml working concentrations of the peptides were coupled to the beads overnight in 4C. Peptide bead conjugates and 25X GSK2033 or T0901317 at each respective concentration were added to appropriate wells. LXR-Peptide interactions were allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature then read using the Bio-Plex 200 system with suspension array platform and the data was assessed with xMAP technology [27–29]. 1A) as an LXR antagonist that displayed high binding affinity for LXR while antagonizing LXR target gene expression in cell culture [21]. 1B, GSK2033 dose-dependently suppressed basal transcription in full-length LXRα or full-length LXRβ cotransfection assays with IC50s of 17 nM and 9 nM, respectively. Both LXRs share a high degree of homology and act as cholesterol sensors, activated by cholesterol derivatives and regulate reverse cholesterol transport [1–7]. HepG2 cells were treated for 24 h with GSK2033 followed by assessment of expression of these genes by qPCR. Prior to initiation of animal efficacy studies, exposure of the drug was determined for both plasma and liver samples. Prior to initiation of animal efficacy studies, exposure of the drug was determined for both plasma and liver samples. The lack of suppression of Tnfa expression, as we had observed with SR9238 treatment [24], is likely due to the fact that there was no decrease in steatosis, which is the inflammatory stimulus. Given that many of these receptors are expressed in the liver, this could clearly underlie the unexpected results we observed on gene expression in this tissue. LXR is ligand-activated nuclear receptor that plays a role in cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis and is also a potential drug target for the treatment of several diseases including atherosclerosis [11,9,12], Alzheimer's Disease [33] and NAFLD/NASH [24,25]. LXR is ligand-activated nuclear receptor that plays a role in cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis and is also a potential drug target for the treatment of several diseases including atherosclerosis [11,9,12], Alzheimer's Disease [33] and NAFLD/NASH [24,25]. Several studies have previously shown the beneficial effects on atherosclerosis when treating with LXR agonists such as T0901317 or GSK3965 [8,12,34–36], however the development of LXR agonists for cardiovascular disease has been limited since these compounds induce hepatic lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia [3]. Lipogenesis is elevated in NAFLD and suppression of this pathway may be useful in treatment of this disease as well as its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We found that SR9238, a liver selective LXR inverse agonist, effectively suppressed lipogenesis in a mouse model of NAFLD and effectively blocked hepatic steatosis even though the mice remained on a high fat diet [24]. GSK2033 is described as a LXR antagonist [21] although we observed clear inverse agonist activity as well.
