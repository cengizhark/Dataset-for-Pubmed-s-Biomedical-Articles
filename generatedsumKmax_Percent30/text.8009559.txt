IL-22 and IL-10Rb were expressed at low levels in RGCs but were present across many RGC types (Figure S3A). IL-22 and IL-10Rb were expressed at low levels in RGCs but were present across many RGC types (Figure S3A). We observed a 2-fold increase in Atf3 mRNA in edited retina compared with unedited retina, in addition to marked 4-fold and 3-fold increases in Sprr1a and Galanin transcripts, respectively (Figure 5A). Stat3 transcript levels were quantified 3 d after ONC (Figure 5C). Strong induction of Atf3 (activating transcription factor 3) and Sprr1a (small proline-rich repeat protein 1a) demarcate the enhanced regeneration of axotomized PNS neurons (Bonilla et al , 2002; Hyatt Sachs et al , 2007; Starkey et al , 2009; Tsujino et al , 2000).

Importantly, Lif is a member of the glycoprotein-130 (gp130)-activating cytokine family, which is neuroprotective and activates Stat3 (Leibinger et al , 2009, 2013a).

Most notably, Il10 and Il24 boasted transcript increases six times and 28 times, respectively, higher than that of LacZ. Clearly, loss of IL-22 stimulates a shift in the expression of cytokines that are well known in their role of potentiating Stat3 activation leading to axon regeneration.The increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests an enhanced immune reaction in response to the loss of IL-22.

Therefore, we evaluated markers of immune and glial cell activation after IL-22 editing in the injured retina. Greater immune cell activity after IL-22 inhibitionTo characterize the immune cell response to IL-22 suppression, we analyzed the localization of microglia/macrophages among retinal layers after injury. We applied genome-wide in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function screening methods to define mechanisms of adult mammalian CNS axonal regeneration. Airn is an RNA that paternally silences the Igf2R gene (Santoro et al , 2013), whose unimpeded function is to bind and traffic Igf2 for lysosomal degradation (Oka et al , 1985; Wang et al , 1994).

Our results place IL-22—alongside Stat3, DLK, and RAG expression (Bollaerts et al , 2017)—as a critical node in the inflammatory response to nerve injury. Analysis of IL-22 inhibition revealed that endogenous IL-22 suppresses the inflammation after ONC and prevents upregulation of Stat3 activators DLK and RAGs. After suppression of IL-22, the axotomy signal mediated by DLK and p-STAT3 initiates greater and more-rapid cytokine and growth factor induction as well as glial migration and activation. Using shRNA-AAV (adeno-associated virus) and CRISPR-AAV-mediated inhibition, we assayed 392 genes and identified 40 targets whose loss-of-function after ONC produced enhanced RGC regeneration.

Although IL-22 can activate Stat3, it has complicated signaling functions (Dudakov et al , 2015). Although IL-22 can activate Stat3, it has complicated signaling functions (Dudakov et al , 2015). After ONC, the enhanced cytokine-driven immune response is pro-regenerative. IL-22Ra1 was more abundant on glial cells, as previously described (Perriard et al , 2015).

Paracrine factors may then stifle neuronal-specific increases in activated Stat3, DLK, and RAG expression to attenuate axon regeneration with endogenous IL-22. Future studies of the multiple pathways demonstrated here are expected to provide new molecular avenues to promote neural repair.

Fourteen days following AAV injection, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Fourteen days following AAV injection, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Alexa 555-CTB (cholera toxin subunit B, Thermo Fisher) was injected intravitreally 14 d post-ONC injury to anterogradely label axons. Non-targeting shRNA was generated as a control (target sequence: CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA). A negative control sgRNA sequence targeting the LacZ gene from E. coli was generated using the sequence TGCGAATACGCCCACGCGAT. Following maxi prep (QIAGEN), Sanger sequencing confirmed correct shRNA and sgRNA insertion using the U6 promoter sequencing primers (5′ to 3′) TGGACCATCCTCTAGACT and (5′ to 3′) GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATTC, respectively.Transfection of HEK293T cells and AAV vector productionCells were passaged the day before transfection at a density of 107 cells per 15-cm plate and were transfected at approximately 80% confluency. Briefly, 72 h following transfection, the supernatant was collected, filtered using a 0.22 μm cellulose acetate filter (Corning), and stored at −80°C. Seventy-two hours after HEK293T cell transfection, cells were collected, subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles to release viral particles into the supernatant, treated with DNaseI (10 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and benzonase (50 U/ml, Millipore) for 30 min at 37°C, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. Samples were compared against a standard curve derived from a virus of known titer diluted from 1013 to 108 copies per ml. Representative z stack images were taken at 20x using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).RGC survivalEyes were removed and fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature. Following a 1 h incubation in PBS containing 5% NDS, retinas were incubated with a Rbpms primary antibody (1:1000; PhosphoSolutions, #1830-Rbpms) for 3 d at 4°C. Cell counts were performed on an Axio Imager M2 (Zeiss) with a 10x objective, and representative images were taken at 40x on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). Secondary antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature using AF488 or AF555 IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen), or AF488 IgM (1:1000, Thermo Fisher). Achieving neuroprotection and neuroregeneration after injury remains a challenging and elusive goal. Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: anti-Pten (1:1000, CST), anti-Il22 (1:1000, Millipore), anti-p-STAT3 (1:2000, CST), anti-DLK (1:1000, Genetex), anti-β-actin (1:2000, CST). Following cryopreservation in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose at 4°C for 30 min, 2 h and overnight, respectively, eyes were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and sectioned at 10 μm using a cryostat. Following primary antibody application and washing, tissue was subsequently incubated in AF594, AF546, AF647, or AF488 secondary antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Retinas were subsequently washed in PBS, incubated with an AF488 secondary antibody (1:400; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, and washed in PBS.FACS sorting, next-generation sequencing and indel detectionFourteen days after AAV injection with either LacZ or Il22 sgRNA-AAV, single retinas were enzymatically digested in 0.125% collagenase for 1 h at 37°C. Following mechanical digestion and single-cell suspension, cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% BSA) and blocked with a monoclonal antibody to CD16/CD32 (1:500, Biolegend) for 10 min at 4°C.

The scrambled-sequence control background averaged eight axons (5.8–10.6, 95% confidence interval) compared with a positive control from Pten knockdown of 148 axons (111–186, 95% confidence interval) (e.g., Park et al , 2008; Yungher et al , 2015; Zukor et al , 2013).This screen identified 40 genes with increased regeneration phenotypes relative to the control, as defined either by significant increases of the average number of axons compared with the scrambled sequence (p < 0.05) or by an average more than one control standard deviation above the scrambled value (Figures 1C–1E; Table S2). Rab proteins have been implicated in axonal growth (Hernández-Deviez et al , 2004), and our unbiased genome-wide cortical neuron regeneration assessment revealed a functional role for 10 different Rab proteins in axon regeneration (Sekine et al , 2018). To that end, we employed the dual-vector CRISPR system that packages single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes) cassettes in different viral vectors (Figure 2A; Table S3; Swiech et al , 2015). To that end, we employed the dual-vector CRISPR system that packages single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes) cassettes in different viral vectors (Figure 2A; Table S3; Swiech et al , 2015). Mouse cortical neuron cultures from P1 pups were used to quantify editing at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Pten-3 (referred to hereafter as “Pten”) produced greater editing overall and was, therefore, selected for use in subsequent assays.It is worth noting that although DNA editing efficiency was low for the Pten-1 species, its minimal disruption in the Pten locus was sufficient to cause a significant decrease in protein expression. Likewise, for the positive regeneration gene Rassf3, minimal disruption at the sgRNA-targeted DNA locus supported substantial protein reduction (Figure 2G). Likewise, for the positive regeneration gene Rassf3, minimal disruption at the sgRNA-targeted DNA locus supported substantial protein reduction (Figure 2G). The activity of Myl10 is consistent with actin-myosin interactions in neuronal growth cones (Jian et al , 1996), Airn with IGF2 signaling (Santoro et al , 2013), and Prg2 with axonal growth and IGF signaling (Glerup et al , 2006; Overgaard et al , 2000; Weyer and Glerup, 2011). We assayed the number of RGCs 14 d after ONC, when approximately 80% of these neurons have undergone apoptosis (Berkelaar et al , 1994; Nadal-Nicolás et al , 2015; Tran et al , 2019).

As expected, only 25% of RGCs survived after injury in sgRNA-LacZ-injected retinas. In line with previous findings (Park et al , 2008), Pten loss-of-function salvaged a significant fraction of the RGC population (34% survival).

Editing of Myl10 showed a trend toward increased RGC numbers 14 d after injury, whereas IL-22, Prg2, and Airn did not alter survival.

Stat3, a key player in this pathway, is a recognized regulator of regeneration (Qiu et al , 2005). Among the four genes with involvement in Jak-Stat signaling, IL-22 editing showed the most significant regeneration phenotype in vivo (Figures 3A and 3C).
