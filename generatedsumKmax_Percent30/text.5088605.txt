Therefore, we constructed an urge-tic network using the coordinates of brain areas recruited before and at tic onset as nodes.12 We also added the right dAI that demonstrated robust activity during suppression of urge to blink as a node to our urge-tic network.4 We tested this urge-tic network using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data previously obtained from TS patients and matched controls15 and examined the behavior of the right dAI within this network using graph theoretical network analysis. Imaging data analysisResting-state fMRIThe resting-state fMRI data were analyzed using the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software.19 The afni_proc.py script for preprocessing and @ANATICOR script for artifact detection and removal from resting-state time series were used as previously described.15,20 We removed the first three EPI volumes and slice time- and motion-corrected the rest of them. Most patients with TS describe unpleasant bodily sensations preceding the tics1 that are perceived as an urge to act.2 The pathophysiology of tics in TS is attributed to dysfunction in multiple areas of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits.3 Furthermore, evidence from functional neuroimaging studies suggests a role for the insula in urge,4 making it an area of interest to understand the urge to tic in TS patients. 1A, Table 1, Supplementary Data).We then extracted the BOLD signal time courses from spheres with a radius of 5 mm centered on each node. In this context, these correlation coefficients are called “connections.”Graph Metric CalculationGraph metrics were calculated using custom MATLAB scripts containing functions from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox.22 For each node of the urge-tic network, we calculated the degree and node strength as a general measure of connectivity, global efficiency and betweenness centrality as measures of functional integration, and clustering coefficient and local efficiency as measures of functional segregation (Table 2). Body parts involved in motor tics and number of patients who had these tics were as follows: Eye blinking and other eye movements (N = 8), face (N = 12), head (N = 9), neck and shoulder (N = 6), arm/hand (N = 5), leg/foot/toe (N = 6), abdomen (N = 5).

The differences in clustering and local efficiency did not reach our significance criteria. Post-hoc behavioral correlations with network findingsWe found significant positive correlations between PUTS scores and right dAI – right SMA2 unthresholded connectivity (F = 9.49, t = 3.08, p = 0.012) and between PUTS scores and right dAI – left SMA1 unthresholded connectivity (F = 5.78, t = 2.40, p = 0.037). The mid-posterior part is involved in somatosensory processing.26,27 It is also functionally connected to the somatosensory cortex and SMA.16 The dAI, on the other hand, integrates multimodal sensory, emotional, and cognitive information, and is involved in interoception.6,7,10,16 Neuroimaging studies of normal bodily urges in healthy subjects and urge/tic in TS patients reported mid-posterior insula activity,10-13 but not dAI activity. The right dAI activity became manifest only when the hemodynamic response function associated with urge was modeled as a “build-up” prior to action.4 Our finding of higher betweenness centrality of the right dAI points to a relative anterior shift regarding the bridging role of the insula within the urge-tic network in the TS group. The sensation that our bladder is full is distinct from the need (urge) to empty it.5 Therefore, in this study, we focused on the urge to tic regardless of the specific nature of these sensations, and postulated a role for the insula - specifically the dorsal anterior part - in heightened interoceptive awareness leading to the urge to tic. Based on this, we argue that the perception of bodily sensations and urges associated with tics may be enhanced in TS patients leading to stronger recruitment of the right dAI. Striatothalamic nodesWe found increased degree and node strength in the right thalamus and increased betweenness centrality in the right putamen in the TS group.These findings support evidence for thalamus and basal ganglia pathology in TS. Specifically, significant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic38,39 and cholinergic neuronal loss in the putamen was demonstrated.39 In addition, deep brain stimulation of the centromedian-parafascicular complex of the thalamus reduced tics.40 This complex, as well as the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, send topographically specific projections to the striatum highlighting the importance of the thalamostriatal system in tic generation.41Neuroimaging studies also provide evidence for thalamus and basal ganglia involvement in tic generation.

Based on our results demonstrating connections between the right dAI and frontostriatal nodes in the TS group, we posit that the right dAI might impose the limbic drive on the dorsomedial frontal nodes by conveying the heightened awareness of bodily sensations to these regions. The highly engaged striatothalamic nodes would then provide the cues facilitating tic release through the “loosened” frontal control gates.Consistent with its role in awareness, the insula is also part of the mesocorticolimbic reward system and shows drug-cue reactivity in addiction leading to cravings.42 Indeed, deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the insula combined with exposure to smoking cues was effective in smoking cessation.43 We think that our findings also have therapeutic implications and propose that stimulating the right dAI, for instance using rTMS, might be a promising treatment strategy to control the urge to tic in TS.
