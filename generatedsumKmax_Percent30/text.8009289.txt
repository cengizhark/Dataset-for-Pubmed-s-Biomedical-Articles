Typical AFM images are shown in Figure 5A and C.Most of the DNA-protein complexes appear as particle assemblies along with a few double-particle complexes in which one particle is larger than the other one.

These results suggest that when RecG is active in the presence of ATP, it can rewind the complementary region on the fork substrate displacing SSB from the ssDNA.To investigate if the shift in the position of SSB was due to the regression of DNA by RecG, we performed experiments in the presence of the non-hydrolysable analog ATPγS, instead of ATP. As the forks used in this study were static, fork regression could not be visualized and in addition, the interplay between SSB and RecG during this process could not be studied. Analysis shows that the histograms of the SSB-RecG distance are similar in the absence and presence of ATP. As we reported earlier13, RecG translocates to the side of SSB in both direction in an ATP independent manner. Consequently, RecG, with binding predicted to be mediated by the helicase domains, binds preferentially to the parental duplex region ahead of the fork. In fact, mismatches in this region impair RecG binding onto the parental DNA duplex (manuscript in preparation). In fact, mismatches in this region impair RecG binding onto the parental DNA duplex (manuscript in preparation). The RecG-dependent shift in this ratio was only observed in the presence of ATP since the equilibrium between S1 and S2 was unaltered in the absence of ATP or in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable analog, ATPγS. Although the remodeling of RecG by SSB was observed on the dynamic fork, the yield of double-blob complexes was considerably lower when compared with the static fork used previously 14.

Pooled fractions from the hydroxylapatite column were dialyzed overnight in S buffer [10 mM KPO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 100 mM KCl]. The protein concentration was spectrophotometrically determined using an extinction coefficient of 49500 M−1 cm−115.SSB protein was purified from strain K12DH1Dtrp, as described in ref 16. Briefly, freshly cleaved mica was incubated in 4ml APS (167 μM) in a cuvette for 30 min and then rinsed with ddH2O thoroughly, as described in ref 14. Ten microliters of the sample were deposited onto the APS mica for 2 min, cleaned with ddH2O, and dried with a gentle Argon gas flow. Sample preparation for time-lapse imaging in liquid with high-speed AFM (HS-AFM).The fresh cleaved mica was incubated with 2.5μl of the APS for 30min and then washed with ddH2O. The image size was usually set to 300x300 nm with 1nm/pixel resolution, and the scan rate was 800 ms/frame.

Experimental design.The fork design used in this study has a 3’-end, 69nt ssDNA tail inserted between two heterologous duplex regions of different lengths (Figure 1), similar to the static fork DNA substrate Fork 4 (F4) which we used previously 13. This design allows the joint position to move between state S1 and state S2 as shown in Figure 1. A representative frame of AFM images of F12 on APS mica is shown in Figure 2. The average peak positions are 281 ± 9 bp and 308 ± 12 bp which corresponds to the two states of F12. Assembly of a Holliday junction within the F12 template.To further confirm the mobility of fork position between the two states, a 69 nt ssDNA, which is complementary to the 69 nt ssDNA in F12 was annealed to the fork. However, if the fork is in state S2, a four-way Holliday junction will be formed instead.The representative AFM images of the annealed DNA are shown in Figure 3B.
