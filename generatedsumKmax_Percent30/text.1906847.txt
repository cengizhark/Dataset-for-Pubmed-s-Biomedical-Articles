Cells from EBs formed in the absence of inhibitor for 3.75 days, to allow for formation of the BL-CFC, were plated under blast colony forming conditions in the presence or absence of 5 μM LY294002. Within 1-2 days in culture the BL-CFC first proliferates to form a tight core of cells. Disruption of p85α alone has demonstrated a role for PI3Ks in erythropoiesis (Huddleston et al , 2003), while p85α-/- / p85β-/+ fetal liver-derived haemopoietic stem cells have recently been reported to have reduced repopulating ability (Haneline et al , 2006).

However, analyses of marker gene expression indicated that haemopoietic differentiation can still occur within the cells which do develop, so we decided to investigate whether these cells could generate mature haemopoietic lineages.

In contrast, inhibition of PI3Ks during the first 3.75 days of EB development, prior to re-plating in blast culture conditions (EB 5LY/blast 0LY), had no effect on the potential of blast-derived cells to generate haemopoietic colonies, confirming that PI3K inhibition during early EB development does not affect formation of the BL-CFC or its subsequent haemopoietic potential. 6B) dramatically reduced the number of myeloid colonies formed and to a lesser extent the number of mixed colonies. Interestingly, in this condition the number of small primitive erythroid colonies did not alter; however, there appeared to be a decrease in the number of larger definitive erythroid colonies formed in the presence of LY294002. Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a unique in vitro model system in which the contribution of specific signals to early developmental stages can be examined (Doetschman et al , 1985; Keller et al , 1993; Keller, 1995). Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a unique in vitro model system in which the contribution of specific signals to early developmental stages can be examined (Doetschman et al , 1985; Keller et al , 1993; Keller, 1995). The regulation of undifferentiated ES cell proliferation by PI3K-dependent signalling has been reported (Hallmann et al , 2003; Jirmanova et al , 2002; Paling et al , 2004; Sun et al , 1999; Takahashi et al , 2003) but very little is known about the involvement of PI3K signalling pathways during early stages of ES cell differentiation. Despite the fact that embryos as early as the 1 cell stage express multiple class IA isoforms (Lu et al , 2004; Riley et al , 2005b), this evidence suggests a non-redundant role for class IA PI3Ks. What we found surprising was that despite the decrease in EB cellularity, the timing of early haemopoietic differentiation events, as evidenced by cell surface expression, gene expression analyses and formation of BL-CFCs, did not appear to be inhibited under conditions of PI3K inhibition or PDK1-deficiency, suggesting that PI3K signalling is dispensable for commitment towards the haemopoietic lineage during EB development. Using ES cell differentiation, a progenitor representing the earliest stage of haemopoietic commitment has been identified (Choi et al , 1998; Nishikawa et al , 1998). This begins to shed light on the signals required for expansion and differentiation of the BL-CFC, about which little is known. VEGF, the ligand for Flk-1, plays a role in blast colony formation, although it is not known whether this involves PI3K signalling. Consistent with a requirement for class IA PI3K-mediated signals in the expansion of haemopoietic progenitors, c-kit+ haemopoietic progenitors derived from p85α-/- (Haneline et al , 2006; Huddleston et al , 2003) or p85α-/- p85β-/+ (Haneline et al , 2006; Huddleston et al , 2003) fetal liver show decreased proliferation in response to SCF.

During the preparation of this manuscript, a requirement for class IA PI3Ks in the function of fetal liver-derived haemopoietic stem cells was reported (Haneline et al , 2006) which demonstrated significantly reduced myeloid repopulating activity of p85α-/- / p85β-/+ adult HSCs. Colony assaysEmbryoid bodies were harvested, washed in PBS (Invitrogen) and trypsinized for 3 minutes at 37°C. To further examine the role of PI3K-dependent signalling pathways during early development and more specifically developmental haemopoiesis, we have used ES cells as an in vitro model and employed both pharmacological and genetic approaches to manipulate PI3K activity at different stages of differentiation.

Immunobloting was performed using primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution: rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognising dual phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235/236 (anti-P-S6, Cell Signal Technologies, 2211) or SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) or goat polyclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Santa Cruz, sc-20357). Non-specific binding to Fc receptors was blocked by incubation with mouse anti-CD16/CD32 (FcγIII/II receptors; 1:2500; BD PharMingen) for 30 minutes on ice. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCanto cytometer (Becton Dickenson) and the data were analysed with FACSDiva software. LY294002 is a reversible inhibitor (in vitro IC50 1.4 μM) of all classes of PI3Ks (class IA, IB, II and III), although the activity of PI3K-C2α is refractory to concentrations of LY294002 that inhibit the activity of the other PI3K family members (Knight et al , 2006; Vlahos et al , 1994).

Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl, comprising 0.5 μM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 μl SYBR Green, and 2 μl of appropriately diluted cDNA (prepared as described above). Subsequent amplification and online monitoring was performed using the LightCycler™ system (Roche Applied Science). S6 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in EBs treated with 5 μM LY294002 and almost completely inhibited with 10 μM LY294002.LY294002 inhibits all classes of PI3Ks, with the exception of PI3K-C2α (Knight et al , 2006; Vlahos et al , 1994) and we wanted to investigate more specifically the role of class IA PI3Ks.

Members of the class IA family of PI3Ks are composed of a regulatory subunit (p85 or p55) and a p110 catalytic subunit (α, β or δ) and are activated by numerous growth factors and cytokines (Cantley, 2002; Vanhaesebroeck et al , 2001; Vanhaesebroeck and Waterfield, 1999). ES cells in which both copies of the PDK1 gene were disrupted (PDK1-/- ES cells (Williams et al , 2000)) formed EBs that were reduced in size, with a 2-3 fold decrease in cellularity compared to wild type parental ES cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that PDK1 is required in the pathway leading to phosphorylation of S6, as previously reported (Williams et al , 2000). 2D), indicating that PDK1 is required in the pathway leading to phosphorylation of S6, as previously reported (Williams et al , 2000). 2D), indicating that PDK1 is required in the pathway leading to phosphorylation of S6, as previously reported (Williams et al , 2000). In contrast, when we performed similar experiments with day 6 PDK1-deficient EB-derived cells, only very small erythroid colonies formed (Fig. We were interested in further defining the stage at which PI3K signalling was required.The emergence of different ES cell-derived haemopoietic populations within the developing EB can be tracked by expression of specific cell surface markers (Kabrun et al , 1997; Mikkola et al , 2003; Nishikawa et al , 1998). Flk-1 is initially expressed on blast colony forming cells (BL-CFCs) and represents the onset of embryonic haemopoiesis (Faloon et al , 2000; Fehling et al , 2003; Kabrun et al , 1997), whereas c-kit marks cells committed to the haemopoietic lineage which arise during the early stages of EB development (Fehling et al , 2003; Ling and Neben, 1997; Ogawa et al , 1991). Importantly, a Flk-1+/c-kit+ double-positive population was observed on day 4 which increased over the next 48 hours. Expression of Brachyury was reduced in day 3 EBs formed in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. Importantly, deletion of p110β leads to a very early developmental defect, resulting in embryonic lethality at the pre-implantation blastocyst stage (Bi et al , 2002). Culturing EBs with 5 μM LY294002 had little or no affect on the number of blast colonies formed (Fig.
