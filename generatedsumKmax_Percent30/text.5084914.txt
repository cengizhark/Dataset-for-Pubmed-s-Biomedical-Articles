Sensitivity analyses excluding non-white individuals, as well as data points subsequent to diagnosis of AD or MCI, yielded similar findings. Our samples included a large number of participants and up to 7 serial assessments, with 3 or more measurements in more than one-third of the samples. In contrast to the effects of APOE genotype on Aβ biomarker levels, APOE genotype did not significantly modify rates of change in Aβ over time. Together, these findings suggest that APOE ε4 carriers are further along in the disease process, but that effects of APOE genotype on disease progression are less pronounced.

We found an overall increase in PET-PiB cDVR of 0.86% per year. Similarly, we found complementary longitudinal decreases in CSF Aβ1–42 of 5.51 pg/ml per year in BIOCARD, a distinct longitudinal cohort with a younger mean age. Consistent with our initial report in a smaller sample[7] and findings from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study[29], longitudinal increases in PiB retention were most pronounced in individuals with more than minimal baseline Aβ, approaching 2% per year in our subgroup of Aβ accumulators. Consistent with our initial report in a smaller sample[7] and findings from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study[29], longitudinal increases in PiB retention were most pronounced in individuals with more than minimal baseline Aβ, approaching 2% per year in our subgroup of Aβ accumulators. Prospective studies using both biomarkers in the same sample are necessary to test this hypothesis. Our second goal was to confirm the reported effect of APOE genotype on Aβ burden and to investigate potential effects of APOE genotype on rates of increase in Aβ. Our findings confirm cross-sectional observations[11,12] that Aβ levels are higher in APOE ε4 carriers vs. non-carriers at any given age during the preclinical phase, consistent with a younger onset of brain Aβ deposition and a later disease stage in APOE ε4 carriers compared with non-carriers. Limitations of our study include the relatively high level of education which characterizes both cohorts and may limit generalizability to individuals with lower educational levels. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted annually and MRI scans and CSF and blood specimens were obtained approximately every 2 years. [1] However, studies of the effect of APOE ε4 genotype on rate of disease progression have shown inconsistent associations. [15]At baseline, all participants completed a comprehensive evaluation at the Clinical Center of the NIH.

Individuals were excluded from participation if they were cognitively impaired, as determined by cognitive testing, or had significant medical, psychiatric, or neurologic disorders. Individuals were excluded from participation if they were cognitively impaired, as determined by cognitive testing, or had significant medical, psychiatric, or neurologic disorders. Since the study has been conducted at Johns Hopkins, the clinical evaluation has included the following: a physical and neurologic examination, assessments of medication use, behavioral and mood assessments, family history of dementia, history of symptom onset, and a Clinical Dementia Rating, based on a semi-structured interview. PET data were acquired according to the following protocol for the duration of the frames: 4×0.25, 8×0.5, 9×1, 2×3, and 10×5 min (70 min total, 33 frames). Dynamic images were reconstructed using filtered back-projection with a ramp filter (image size = 128 × 128, pixel size = 2 × 2 mm, slice thickness = 4.25 mm), yielding a spatial resolution of approximately 4.5 mm FWHM at the center of the field of view.The Statistical Parametric Mapping PET template was affinely registered onto the 20-minute mean PET-PiB image for each PET scan study separately, and the resulting transformations were used to map the AAL atlas labels[25] accordingly on each PET-PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) image. CSF measurementDetailed procedures for acquisition and measurement of CSF Aβ1–42 are described in Moghekar et al [15] Briefly, CSF was collected from 307 participants at baseline. The CSF specimens were analyzed using the same protocol used in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The kit contains monoclonal antibodies specific for Ab1–42 (4D7A3), total tau (t-tau) (AT120), and p-tau181p (AT270), each chemically bonded to unique sets of color-coded beads, and analyte-specific detector antibodies (HT7, 3D6). Calibration curves were produced for each biomarker using aqueous buffered solutions that contained the combination of 3 biomarkers at concentrations ranging from 25 to 1,555 pg/mL for recombinant tau, 54 to 1,799 pg/mL for synthetic Ab1–42, and 15 to 258 pg/mL for a synthetic tau peptide phosphorylated at the threonine 181 position (i.e., the p-tau181p standard).

All assays were run in triplicate. PET-PiB Imaging in BLSAPET-PiB cDVR showed significant cross-sectional elevations with advancing age (p = 0.002). Longitudinal findings revealed overall increases in PET-PiB cDVR over time in the whole sample, after adjusting for baseline age and sex, of 0.86% per year (p<0.0001).

Longitudinal findings revealed overall increases in PET-PiB cDVR over time in the whole sample, after adjusting for baseline age and sex, of 0.86% per year (p<0.0001). In contrast, individuals with minimal PiB retention at baseline (cDVR less than 1.15) tended to remain stable over time (0.40% per year). [6] These tools permit investigation of Aβ deposition over time, as well as associations between Aβ burden and APOE genotype. Overall rates of CSF declines over time were -5.51 pg/ml per year (p = 0.005). Overall rates of CSF declines over time were -5.51 pg/ml per year (p = 0.005). Overall rates of CSF declines over time were -5.51 pg/ml per year (p = 0.005). APOE ε4 carriers compared with non-carriers had significantly higher Aβ burden overall (p = 0.001).
