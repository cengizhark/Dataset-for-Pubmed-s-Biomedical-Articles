This can be operationally defined as the period between the midway position, λt, the leading and following edges and the end of the outbreak (t = T + 0.5). 3.5 Spatial versions of the basic reproduction number, R0The basic reproduction number2, R0, is one of the most useful parameters used to characterize mathematically infectious disease processes. 3.5 Spatial versions of the basic reproduction number, R0The basic reproduction number2, R0, is one of the most useful parameters used to characterize mathematically infectious disease processes. 3.5 Spatial versions of the basic reproduction number, R0The basic reproduction number2, R0, is one of the most useful parameters used to characterize mathematically infectious disease processes. This raises the prospect of defining a spatial version of R0. Values over unity imply a tendency to spread and calibrate the velocity of such spread (the larger the value, the greater the rate of spread). But how far do the methods work when applied to actual epidemic waves of infectious diseases? But how far do the methods work when applied to actual epidemic waves of infectious diseases? To conduct a more realistic test we follow in the classic footsteps of Bailey (1953) in using outbreaks of the highly contagious human virus disease, measles, for our epidemic modelling. 4.1 Results for a single epidemic wave (Wave III)The first of the Icelandic measles waves to be analyzed was triggered by the arrival in Reykjavík harbour in April 1916 of a ship from Norway with a sailor still infectious with measles. 4.1 Results for a single epidemic wave (Wave III)The first of the Icelandic measles waves to be analyzed was triggered by the arrival in Reykjavík harbour in April 1916 of a ship from Norway with a sailor still infectious with measles. 4.1 Results for a single epidemic wave (Wave III)The first of the Icelandic measles waves to be analyzed was triggered by the arrival in Reykjavík harbour in April 1916 of a ship from Norway with a sailor still infectious with measles. Differences between the two series plotted in (c) are illustrated in Fig. 3d and e. The mean values for the two series are used to define the swash and backwash stages of Wave III in Fig. Finally, cumulative curves for the number of newly infected and newly terminated districts used to define susceptible, infective and recovered districts appear in Fig. Finally, cumulative curves for the number of newly infected and newly terminated districts used to define susceptible, infective and recovered districts appear in Fig. Finally, cumulative curves for the number of newly infected and newly terminated districts used to define susceptible, infective and recovered districts appear in Fig. Finally, cumulative curves for the number of newly infected and newly terminated districts used to define susceptible, infective and recovered districts appear in Fig. 4.2 Results for a train of epidemic events (Waves III–XVI)How far are the results for the first wave (Wave III) representative of the whole 60-year sequence of waves? 4.2 Results for a train of epidemic events (Waves III–XVI)How far are the results for the first wave (Wave III) representative of the whole 60-year sequence of waves? 4.2 Results for a train of epidemic events (Waves III–XVI)How far are the results for the first wave (Wave III) representative of the whole 60-year sequence of waves? 4.2 Results for a train of epidemic events (Waves III–XVI)How far are the results for the first wave (Wave III) representative of the whole 60-year sequence of waves? 8 presents the cumulative curves for 14 separate measles epidemic waves in Iceland over the 60-year period for both newly-infected districts and newly-terminated districts. 8a) are steeper than those for newly terminated districts (Fig. 9 which shows the superimposed cumulative curves from the previous figure to define susceptible, infective and recovered zones when plotted on a phase diagram. 10 which plots the three dimensions of the susceptible, infective and recovered phases for each the 14 epidemic waves as a ternary diagram. 10 which plots the three dimensions of the susceptible, infective and recovered phases for each the 14 epidemic waves as a ternary diagram. 10 which plots the three dimensions of the susceptible, infective and recovered phases for each the 14 epidemic waves as a ternary diagram. It is notable that the early waves (shaded) lie broadly to the left of the later, post Second World War, waves on the susceptible phase axis of the ternary diagram. It is notable that the early waves (shaded) lie broadly to the left of the later, post Second World War, waves on the susceptible phase axis of the ternary diagram. Table 3 confirms that the leading edge is very significantly faster whether measured in months (nearly three months faster) or when standardized by the overall duration of the epidemic wave (14% faster). Table 3 confirms that the leading edge is very significantly faster whether measured in months (nearly three months faster) or when standardized by the overall duration of the epidemic wave (14% faster). The third measure, the standard deviation, showed little difference possibly reflecting the influence of a few extreme observations. A fast epidemic wave will display a right-skewed distribution with the majority of cases occurring in the early phases of the epidemic and positive b1 values. Overall, the four standard measures of epidemic velocity suggest that the Icelandic waves we have studied show a distinct tendency to have relatively faster leading edges and relatively slower following edges. This spread process is set into reverse as populations recover and previously-infected areas are cleared. The duration of the stages averages around 8 months for swash and 11 months for backwash. A summary of the mechanisms involved and examples of such spread are given elsewhere (Haggett 2000; Cliff et al  2000). Is there any evidence from the analysis that the epidemic waves are changing systematically over time or may they be regarded as samples drawn from a relatively stable wave population? 12a which plots the decreasing gaps in time between the 14 waves. The eight Icelandic examples used here were computed by hand (a somewhat tedious process) but a computerized version based on morbidity data stored in readily available EXCEL tables is being prepared which should make the computation of basic wave parameters very rapid.

In the exemplar case, the threshold of the model was set to one (qij = 1). But for many diseases the pattern may be less clear cut. This happens with many communicable diseases in large populations. The swash–backwash model may be readily adjusted to include such non-discrete examples by resetting the threshold so that either (a) qij > 1 or (b) a particular threshold rate (cases/susceptible population) is exceeded. Extensions of the single wave model to Icelandic epidemics which are recurrent and continuous rather than recurrent but discrete is one obvious pathway.

The results for measles will be compared with those for other infectious diseases which generated single-wave outbreaks in Iceland over the same historical time period.

Making comparisons across different spatial scales and between countries (each of which has its own recording infrastructure) is a classic geographical problem which has long attracted statistical research (Duncan et al  1961). As such it provides a useful approach to diseases which follow this simple structure (classically, measles). As such it provides a useful approach to diseases which follow this simple structure (classically, measles). Here, we have concentrated on the changing spatial distribution of the wave, and we have presented a simple method for identifying the leading and trailing edges of the spatial advance and retreat of such waves. into a new area with a susceptible population which is open to infection. 1 has obvious parallels with the normal and logistic curves in the temporal domain. In this first section we modify standard statistical methods to provide some elementary measures of spatial form and then illustrate their application through a small hypothetical example. 3.1 Analysis of a hypothetical waveWe begin with the observation that a single epidemic wave in any large geographical area is a composite of the waves for each of its constituent sub-areas. 9–19) provides a useful historical review of these early papers. 2 a simple epidemic wave where A = 12, T = 10 and Q = 122. 3a, the 12×10 matrix is re-arranged so as to position the start cells in an ascending temporal order. 3b, so as to arrange the end cells in ascending temporal order. Bailey 1975) but with the essential difference that our population is made up of areas (SA, IA and RA) rather than individuals. The epidemiological significance of the integral values is discussed later in this paper. t¯A are plotted on the time series in Fig. Higher moments about the mean can also be computed to yield valuable measures of epidemiological behaviour.
