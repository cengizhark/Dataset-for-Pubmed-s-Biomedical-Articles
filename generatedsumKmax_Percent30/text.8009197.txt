Furthermore, the gel adhesion strength could also be tuned by competitive monosaccharide molecules, such as glucose and galactose.79The dynamic property of the boronic acid-diol reaction can be further applied to the reversible capture and release of cells. However, upon addition of 70 mM glucose at pH 7.8, the cell-repulsive state was turned on due to the competitive glucose binding on the surface. This setup thus, shows great potential in cell-based diagnostics, in vivo drug delivery, etc.The reversible boronic ester formation reaction can also be coupled with supramolecular electrostatic interactions, leading to controlled cell membrane imaging.140 The main sensing structure was cationic conjugated polyfluorene tagged with phenylboronic acid groups (PFP-PBA), while the cationic part was embedded to target the negatively charged cell membrane (Figure 14). Moreover, D-glucose could be used as a competitor and block the binding sites of PFP-PBA, thereby turning off the cell membrane imaging.Concerning the multiple diols in the complex structures of carbohydrates, in some cases, the specific binding mode is important for further applications. In a recent study, a peptide amphiphile with a benzoboroxole (BOB) group attached at the hydrophilic end was assembled into fibers, leading to aligned BOB/saccharide pairs with low molecular mobility, high density and multivalent effect.141 Thus, enhanced nuclear Overhauser effects could be observed by NMR (NOESY), confirming the binding between BOB and mannopyranoside on the site of diols at 2,3-position instead of 4,6-position.Besides carbohydrate structures, the dynamic polymers can also be used to detect other biomolecules.

For example, dynamic covalent polymers containing entities displaying aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effects have been used for selective detection of ATP.142 The typical AIE luminogen tetraphenylethene (TPE) was first derivatized to yield a tetra-aldehyde, and then linked with an amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) structure (EG,) through imine formation.

With calculated rate and equilibrium constants of model hydrazone reactions, the equilibrium modulus and stress relaxation characteristics of the resulting hydrogels could be estimated, the compatibility regarding timescales of reversible reaction, hydrogel formation and cell encapsulation could be demonstrated.

With calculated rate and equilibrium constants of model hydrazone reactions, the equilibrium modulus and stress relaxation characteristics of the resulting hydrogels could be estimated, the compatibility regarding timescales of reversible reaction, hydrogel formation and cell encapsulation could be demonstrated. Under such circumstances, dynamic hydrogels with shear-thinning and self-healing properties turned out to be a superior option.For example, combining reversible covalent crosslinking with thermoresponsive engineered proteins, injectable hydrogels were produced and used for stem cell delivery.146 Structurally, the designed hydrogels were composed of dual crosslinking: the first of which achieved by mixing hydrazine-modified elastin-like protein (ELP-HYD) and aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-ALD) through reversible hydrazone bonds, while the secondary crosslinking occurred upon heating through the thermoresponsive phase segregation of ELP, reinforcing the whole network (Figure 18). Moreover, hyaluronic acid-collagen hydrogels crosslinked by hydrazone groups proved to promote cell spread, fiber remodeling and focal adhesion formation during 3D cell culture.150 Further application of these self-healing dynamic biomaterials into cell-laden bioinks has also been developed.151 With a judicious selection and design of the building blocks, their arrangement in a preferred order is in principle possible, thereby obtaining materials with desired functions. Furthermore, the peptide hits were converted to bactericidal agents with high antibiotic potency and specificity. Especially when dynamic covalent bonds are involved, the self-healing, injectable, moldable and degradable properties of the dynamic materials often lead to important biomedical functions.A variety of dynamic hydrogels have been designed and applied for wound dressing. Since their inception, dynamic covalent polymers have revealed unique features – adaptive self-fabrication, dynamic responsiveness to physicochemical stimuli, etc. – that turned out to be of great benefit for a wide range of applications, from material science to biomedical applications. Dynamic covalent polymers form a class of adaptive systems that can be efficiently used for biomedical applications. Imines have therefore become very attractive for biomedical applications.Disulfide formation and exchange reactions are also frequently to construct dynamic polymers.31 Both anionic (thiolate) and radical pathways can in this case lead to disulfide recomposition. Imines have therefore become very attractive for biomedical applications.Disulfide formation and exchange reactions are also frequently to construct dynamic polymers.31 Both anionic (thiolate) and radical pathways can in this case lead to disulfide recomposition. In the former case, a redox balance between thiolate and disulfide species leads to exchange. For example, boronic acids grafted to biomaterials can lead to capture and release of cells upon addition of carbohydrates.Olefin metathesis is another important approach to forming reversible C-C bonds.

In analogy to traditional polymers, the dynamic covalent counterparts can thus be built up through different arrangements of the connections, leading to various types of polymer architectures.Typically, there are two approaches for reversible bonds to be inserted into polymeric structures: main-chain and side-chain incorporation (Figure 1).19 The former strategy can lead to formation and collapse of polymer structures under specific conditions, resulting in degradable or self-healing biomaterials, whereas the latter approach can modulate the binding effects during the biorecognition process. In the linear case, homo- or hetero-ditopic complementary building blocks are adopted, whereas tritopic or even tetratopic components are required for construction of cross-linked polymers. This will lead to a situation where the equilibrium can be re-established in the system if the polymer has been damaged by external forces and the dynamic covalent bonds have been broken. Materials used for biological applications, such as cell culture and wound-dressing,73, 74 have taken advantage of the self-healing property of dynamic covalent polymers to achieve their specific functionalities.Recyclability is another important characteristic of dynamic covalent polymers, again enabled by the properties of the incorporated reversible bonds.57 Common covalent polymers cannot be fully restored to their original physical structures or mechanical performances after recycling. In addition, the remaining part of the polymer can often contain pH-sensitive groups, which can result in both conformational and constitutional dynamics of the materials. 3.3Mechanical propertiesDynamic covalent polymers combine the advanced mechanical properties of traditional polymers with the unique features of dynamic covalent bonds, and this can lead to intriguing new effects and altered mechanical performances of the polymers.22 Such mechanical features of dynamic covalent polymers can also be applied in biological systems, for example, by maintaining robust structures in different environments.82Conventional shape-memory polymers are able to recover the original (permanent) geometry after having been persuaded (programmed) into a temporary shape. 4.1Gene deliveryThe non-covalent recognition of nucleic acids by synthetic vectors requires combining multiple weak electrostatic interactions in order to achieve a stable interaction in biological media. This multivalent binding is best achieved using macromolecules such as polymers87–90 and dendrimers.91 Nucleic acids condensation92 is a complex multi-step process (interaction, complexation, folding) that results in the formation of “polyplexes” nanoparticles that can penetrate cells and deliver functional nucleic acids like pDNA, siRNA or mRNA, provided they have appropriate sizes and surface charges. siRNA delivery in live cells was successfully demonstrated.100Peptide building blocks can also be self-assembled into multimeric dynamic covalent polymers using disulfide bond formation, simply through thiol oxidation. Using siRNA as templates, they demonstrated the formation of polydisulfide nanocaplets of small and uniform size which depolymerize in the reductive cytosolic environment and liberate the packaged siRNA.112While dynamic covalent chemistry can happen between building blocks associated onto nucleic acids templates, Matile and coworkers have also found that dynamic covalent exchange can take place during the delivery process, evidencing a covalent and transient binding, through disulfide exchange, with the transferrin receptor which in turns promotes further cell penetration.102, 113, 114Barboiu and coworkers used imines as reversible covalent linkage for generating cross-linked dynamic covalent polymers, coined Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks (DCFs).117–120 The design uses commercially-available 1,3,5-benzenetrialdehyde, a building block which can be connected to mono-, di- and poly-amines through imine-bond formations (Figure 8). Here also, the self-assembly approach alleviates the screening of multiple combinations of different aldehydes, and led to the identification of amphiphilic transporters for pDNA/siRNA/mRNA delivery.124–126 This approach has then been extended using more structured scaffolds such as α-helical peptide scaffolds,127 with a successful implementation for the delivery of gene editing tools.128Although this approach does not allow for adaptive growth and decay as in the previous examples – length of polymer conjugate and density of functional groups being imposed by the structure of the initial polymer scaffold –125 constitutional adaptation can take place in the organization of the aldehydes fragments within the polymer structure (e.g. Here also, the self-assembly approach alleviates the screening of multiple combinations of different aldehydes, and led to the identification of amphiphilic transporters for pDNA/siRNA/mRNA delivery.124–126 This approach has then been extended using more structured scaffolds such as α-helical peptide scaffolds,127 with a successful implementation for the delivery of gene editing tools.128Although this approach does not allow for adaptive growth and decay as in the previous examples – length of polymer conjugate and density of functional groups being imposed by the structure of the initial polymer scaffold –125 constitutional adaptation can take place in the organization of the aldehydes fragments within the polymer structure (e.g. Normally, strategies such as protein engineering and chemical modification are required to improve enzyme performances, but long-term screening processes are usually required. Normally, strategies such as protein engineering and chemical modification are required to improve enzyme performances, but long-term screening processes are usually required. Typical functional amines can be N-(2-aminoethyl) acetamide (3) and poly(amidoamine) dendrimer 4 (ethylene diamine core, generation 1.0), for enhanced H-bonding with the target enzyme.When this type of dynamic covalent network polymer was added into the enzyme reaction solutions, the catalytic activities could be increased, as exemplified for both carbonic anhydrase (CA) and lipases.
