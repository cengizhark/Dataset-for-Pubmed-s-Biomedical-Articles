PCLV primers were previously published: [PCLV-N-qRT-FW: ATAGTGTGGGACGAGGAGGG, PCLV-N-qRT-RV: AGGTGCCAACAGGAAACACT] (Schnettler et al , 2016). mosquitoes and there is a continuing effort to reduce infection through targeting the mosquito host. mosquitoes and there is a continuing effort to reduce infection through targeting the mosquito host. mosquitoes and there is a continuing effort to reduce infection through targeting the mosquito host. mosquitoes and there is a continuing effort to reduce infection through targeting the mosquito host. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 minutes, rinsed, and plaques were counted. Cells were infected with the African ZIKV MR766 and Puerto Rican ZIKV PRVABC59 strains at a low MOI (MOI 0.1) and incubated for six days. Supernatant was collected for six days and ZIKV RNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The presence of mosquito Rps6 transcripts confirmed successful RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Since PCLV is consistently present in A. aegypti cell lines that are variable or non-permissive to ZIKV and not in in the A. albopictus cell lines that are established as ZIKV permissive (Aa23 (Schultz et al , 2017), C710 (Schultz et al , 2017), and C6/36 (Offerdahl et al , 2017)), we hypothesized PCLV affects the growth of ZIKV.

Aag2 cells are more frequently utilized for DENV virus studies (Walker et al , 2014) and CFAV has previously been shown to promote DENV infection (Zhang et al , 2017) suggesting that PCLV may have a more mild effect on DENV growth in a coinfection setting. Cells were infected at a low MOI of 0.1 and a high MOI of 10 with LACV followed by a six or three day incubation, respectively, as depicted in Figure 4A. Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that modulation of the insect virome may have important implications for arbovirus control (Bolling et al , 2015a). Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that modulation of the insect virome may have important implications for arbovirus control (Bolling et al , 2015a). CCL-125 and Aag2 A. aegypti cells can be requested from the ATCC (CCL-125 only) or other researchers (Walker et al , 2014). CCL-125 and Aag2 A. aegypti cells can be requested from the ATCC (CCL-125 only) or other researchers (Walker et al , 2014). CCL-125 and Aag2 A. aegypti cells can be requested from the ATCC (CCL-125 only) or other researchers (Walker et al , 2014). Separate reports have suggested A. aegypti CCL-125 cells are (Wikan et al , 2009) and are not (Singh, 1971; Singh and Paul, 1968) susceptible to DENV. Separate reports have suggested A. aegypti CCL-125 cells are (Wikan et al , 2009) and are not (Singh, 1971; Singh and Paul, 1968) susceptible to DENV.

Separate reports have suggested A. aegypti CCL-125 cells are (Wikan et al , 2009) and are not (Singh, 1971; Singh and Paul, 1968) susceptible to DENV. ZIKV growth in Aag2 cells has variable growth with reported peak titers ranging from 104 PFU/mL (Weger-Lucarelli et al , 2016) to 106 PFU/mL(Fulton et al , 2017; Weger-Lucarelli et al , 2017). Thus, the removal of PCLV or identification of a PCLV-free A. aegypti cell line may improve the function of A. aegypti cell culture system for arbovirus studies. Previous studies have also suggested that ISVs can limit the growth of arboviruses in a co-infection scenario in vitro and in vivo, reviewed by (Blitvich and Firth, 2015; Bolling et al , 2015a; Bolling et al , 2015b).

Nhumirim virus has been shown to limit WNV, St Louis encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Kenney et al , 2014). Because CFAV has previously been reported to be beneficial to DENV replication (Zhang et al , 2017), it is likely that PCLV or a synergistic interaction between PCLV and CFAV causes the observed block in flavivirus replication.

There are many hypotheses about potential mechanisms for arbovirus/ISV competition in mosquito cells. Sindbis virus infection has been shown to prevent cell line infection with other alphaviruses (Karpf et al , 1997). There is a limited availability of antibodies and other molecular tools to investigate the exact mechanism of ISV suppression. There is a limited availability of antibodies and other molecular tools to investigate the exact mechanism of ISV suppression. Thus, expansion of ISV tools would aid our understanding of ISV-arbovirus competition. ISVs have been suggested for the control of arbovirus transmission (Bolling et al , 2015a) based on their inhibition of arboviruses and wide geographic distribution (Cook et al , 2012; Farfan-Ale et al , 2009; Vasilakis et al , 2013; Vasilakis et al , 2014).

Innate immune competent cells such as the A. aegypti cell lines (Aag2 and CCL-125s) represent additional cell lines but have shown variability in virus susceptibility (Singh, 1967; Singh and Paul, 1968; Wikan et al , 2009). Cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) was first identified in 1975 in A. aegypti cells, and was shown to cause a cell fusing phenotype in A. albopictus cells (Stollar and Thomas, 1975). This raises the possibility that these two ISVs could interfere with the growth of arboviruses in the same culture system (Bolling et al , 2015b), as this cell line demonstrates variable growth of ZIKV. We then determined the ability of various arboviruses to grow in the presence or absence of CFAV-PCLV coinfection and if this ISV coinfection could interfere with arbovirus studies.

Negative-sense arboviruses, such as La Crosse virus (LACV), which is a leading cause of pediatric encephalitis in the United States (Bewick et al , 2016), have been circulating in the Americas for a long time. Media was replaced at 24 hours post infection. PCLV primers were previously published: PCLV-N-FW: CAGTTAAAGCATTTAATCGTATGATAA, PCLVN-RV: CACTAAGTGTTACAGCCCTTGGT (Schnettler et al , 2016). Rps6 primers used target a conserved region of A. aegypti and A. albopictus Rps6 gene: mRpS6_F AGTTGAACGTAT CGTTTCCCGCTAC and mRpS6_R GAAGTGACGCAGCT TGTGGTCGTCC (Lee et al , 2012).
