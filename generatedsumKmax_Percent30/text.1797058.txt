This was associated with loss of full-length α2δ-2 protein and expression of a truncated mutant α2δ-2 protein with aberrant function (Brodbeck et al , 2002). The present study was undertaken in order to examine the basis for the ataxic phenotype in ducky mice. 2B, C), and also showed an increased irregularity of firing, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV, Fig. Surprisingly, tonically firing PCs from du2J/+ mice showed a firing rate that was intermediate between WT and du2J/du2J PCs (Fig. 2D).Changes in synaptic transmission, particularly GABAergic transmission, influence the rate and pattern of firing of PCs (Hausser and Clark, 1997). 2D).Changes in synaptic transmission, particularly GABAergic transmission, influence the rate and pattern of firing of PCs (Hausser and Clark, 1997). This represents a two base-pair (bp) deletion in exon 9 of Cacna2d2, and is thus a simpler mutation than the complex rearrangement of the Cacna2d2 gene, and the duplication of other genes, identified in the original du/du mice (Barclay et al , 2001). For +/+ PCs the resting potential (Vrest) could not be determined accurately, since the cells fired spontaneously unless hyperpolarizing current was injected, whereas du2J/du2J PCs were silent at 34°C in the presence of synaptic blockers, both in cell-attached mode and in whole-cell mode, and their Vrest was −47.2 ± 1.1 mV (n = 30). It is therefore likely to represent a clean knockout of α2δ-2 expression, allowing for easier interpretation of the mechanism involved in any changes observed. 3C).For the first action potential evoked by Ithreshold from −72 mV there was no significant difference in the half-width or in the rise time between +/+ and du2J/du2J PCs, and no difference in the characteristics of the after-hyperpolarization following this action potential (data not shown). Furthermore, there was no effect on the sag due to Ih measured with 400 ms hyperpolarizing current steps of between 100 and 900 pA from −72 mV. 4B), rather than being preceded by the decrease in precision as reported previously (Walter et al , 2006). 4B), rather than being preceded by the decrease in precision as reported previously (Walter et al , 2006). 4B), rather than being preceded by the decrease in precision as reported previously (Walter et al , 2006). These results are consistent with the observations of Womack and Khodakhah (2002), demonstrating that Ca2+ entry through P-type Ca2+ channels is required for spontaneous activity in PCs. These results are consistent with the observations of Womack and Khodakhah (2002), demonstrating that Ca2+ entry through P-type Ca2+ channels is required for spontaneous activity in PCs.

TEA (1 mM) caused a small but reversible increase in firing rate of +/+ PCs (data not shown). TEA (1 mM) caused a small but reversible increase in firing rate of +/+ PCs (data not shown). TEA (1 mM) caused a small but reversible increase in firing rate of +/+ PCs (data not shown). TEA (1 mM) caused a small but reversible increase in firing rate of +/+ PCs (data not shown). TEA (1 mM) caused a small but reversible increase in firing rate of +/+ PCs (data not shown). In agreement with the published data on the role of IK(Ca) channels (Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003), blocking SK channels with apamin (100 nM), or blocking BK channels with Penitrem A (10 μM) also increased the rate of firing in +/+ PCs, and resulted in a switch to burst firing (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the initial increase in firing rate seen in response to ω-agatoxin-IVB (Fig. At P10 and P21, Cacna2d2 was called as absent in the ducky samples, however mRNA was present in the P0 samples. These results imply that nonsense-mediated decay of Cacna2d2 mRNA may be more effective in older animals. Using this technique, tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA was found to be up-regulated by 16.3 ± 0.79 fold (n = 10) in du2J/du2J cerebellum at P21 (Fig. In this regard, it is of interest that NaVβ2 is one of the binding partners for tenascin-C (Srinivasan et al , 1998). In this regard, it is of interest that NaVβ2 is one of the binding partners for tenascin-C (Srinivasan et al , 1998). A cDNA construct identical to this predicted product was made and expressed in Cos7 cells. Genomic DNA was prepared from tail biopsies and genotyping was carried out with primers 5′-GGACGTCTTCATCAGCTTCA-3′, and 5′-6FAM-TATACAGGGGGCCTCATCAC-3′, which produced a 219-bp product from the du2J allele, and a 221 bp product from the wild type allele. Tenascin-C exhibits several isoforms, and a progressive decrease in tenascin-C protein molecular weight has been reported to occur during cerebellar development (Bartsch et al , 1992). Similar findings have been reported previously (Cingolani et al , 2002; Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Womack et al , 2004). Similar findings have been reported previously (Cingolani et al , 2002; Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Womack et al , 2004). Similar findings have been reported previously (Cingolani et al , 2002; Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Womack et al , 2004). Similar findings have been reported previously (Cingolani et al , 2002; Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Womack et al , 2004). They also showed that the reduced spontaneous PC firing resulted in disinhibition of the deep cerebellar nuclei, to which the ataxic phenotype was attributed.We have recently found that cerebellar α2δ-2 and CaV2.1 are both strongly localized in lipid rafts (Davies et al , 2006), and it may be that this is relevant to their interaction with other ion channels, such as BK channels which have also been suggested to associate with lipid rafts (Bravo-Zehnder et al , 2000). Of interest in this regard, gabapentin (which binds to both α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits) has been shown to enhance Ih (Surges et al , 2003), although it is unknown whether this occurs via α2δ. While Ih is known to regulate PC activity (Williams et al , 2002), we did not find differences in Ih between +/+ and du2J/du2J PCs. While Ih is known to regulate PC activity (Williams et al , 2002), we did not find differences in Ih between +/+ and du2J/du2J PCs. Phenotype of du2J/+ miceWe previously observed no phenotype in du/+ mice, in terms of obvious behavioral deficit or reduction of IBa in isolated PC somata (Barclay et al , 2001). Differences between our two studies include the fact that the original du mutation also involves duplication of a substantial region of chromosome 9 including the semaphorin-3B gene (Barclay et al , 2001). Furthermore, the genetic background of du/du and du2J/du2J are different and it is well established that this can affect observed channelopathy phenotypes (Sprunger et al , 1999). Furthermore, the genetic background of du/du and du2J/du2J are different and it is well established that this can affect observed channelopathy phenotypes (Sprunger et al , 1999). Furthermore, the genetic background of du/du and du2J/du2J are different and it is well established that this can affect observed channelopathy phenotypes (Sprunger et al , 1999). We have recently observed that expressed α2δ-2 enhanced endogenous IBa in differentiated NG108-15 cells (Canti et al , 2005).

We have recently observed that expressed α2δ-2 enhanced endogenous IBa in differentiated NG108-15 cells (Canti et al , 2005). In certain pathological situations, such as neuropathic pain, α2δ subunit expression is up-regulated (Luo et al , 2001; Newton et al , 2001). Labeling and Array HybridizationSample labeling, hybridization and scanning were performed as recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Tottering (Cacna1atg, tg/tg) has a point mutation in CaV2.1 (α1A) (Fletcher et al , 1996), and a number of alleles of this mutant have now been identified, as summarized recently (Zwingman et al , 2001). A cDNA synthesis kit was utilized (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK), using 5 μg total RNA. Quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from individual cerebella using the RNeasy lipid tissue kit and QiaShredders (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, Sussex, UK). Reverse transcription was carried out on 1 μg RNA using the iScript kit (BioRad, Hercules CA, USA). Lethargic (Cacnb4lh) represents a truncation mutation of the β4 subunit (Burgess et al , 1997). Lethargic (Cacnb4lh) represents a truncation mutation of the β4 subunit (Burgess et al , 1997). For immunohistochemistry 40 μm sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Calbindin D-28K (1.46 μg/ml) at 4° C and detected with Texas Red conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Molecular Probes, 4 μg/ml).

Finally, two ducky alleles (Cacna2d2du, Cacna2d2du2J) both predict truncation mutations in the α2δ-2 subunit (Snell, 1955; Barclay et al , 2001; Brodbeck et al , 2002), whereas the third ducky allele (Cacna2d2entla) predicts a full-length protein with an inserted region in the α2 moiety of α2δ-2 (Brill et al , 2004). The lysed homogenate was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min, 4° C) and the resultant supernatant used in subsequent experiments. PBS-washed Cos7 cell pellets were resuspended in 25 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche, used as above)) and lysed as above. ImmunoblottingImmunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (Page et al , 2004). ImmunoblottingImmunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (Page et al , 2004). ImmunoblottingImmunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (Page et al , 2004). Akt was detected as a loading control, and data were only compared where Akt loading was not different between samples. Data were quantified using ImageQuant 5.2, following verification that images were not saturated. The original ducky allele (du) involves a gene duplication and inversion which disrupts the Cacna2d2 gene within intron 3, but potentially also involves duplication and increased expression of other genes (Barclay et al , 2001). Cells were isolated immediately before use by digestion of slices with papain (20 U/ml) for 5–15 min, then washed and triturated in Ringer’s solution and plated onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips. Ba2+ currents (IBa) were investigated by whole cell patch clamp recording. PC recordings in cerebellar slicesSagittal slices (300 μm thick) obtained from the cerebellum of P17-25 mice (mean age 19.7 ± 0.3) were prepared and maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.1 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, and saturated with 95% O2 5% CO2 (pH 7.4).

Patch pipettes were pulled from thick walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Hertfordshire, UK) to a tip resistance of 4–6 MΩ, when filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 KGluconate, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4 with NaOH and osmolarity 298 mOsm with 25 glucose. Data were acquired at 10 kHz with an Axon Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) using the programs WinWCP and WinEDR (kindly supplied by Dr. J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; available at https://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/spider/index.php. For the whole cell current clamp recordings, PCs were silenced by injecting a weak hyperpolarizing DC current, in order to set the membrane potential to ~−72 mV, before test pulses (ten pulses in 50 or 100 pA steps, 400 ms long) were applied. The potential threshold (Vthreshold) for the first action potential was defined as the voltage at which dV/dt exceeded 25 mV/ms, and was always confirmed by visual inspection of point of inflection at which the upstroke of the action potential occurs. The amplitude of this sag was calculated by subtracting the steady-state potential (measured just before the offset of 400 ms negative current steps between 100and 900 pA) from the peak potential.
