For Hsp70 heterozygotes, the required clamp time increased to 25 min (Figure 2c). GGA, a nontoxic drug currently used to treat human peptic ulcer disease, induced Hsp70, protected tubular structure, and preserved organ function in both wild-type and Hsp70 heterozygote mice (Figure 2b and c). This study opens the door to potential treatment of ischemic AKI by showing that a nontoxic agent already in human use induces Hsp70 in mammalian cells, limits apoptosis, and preserves both organ structure and function even after the insult has occurred. When Akt inactivation is coupled with GSK3β activation, site-specific serine phosphorylation events promote Bax activation and translocation, outer mitochondrial membrane injury, and apoptotic cell death.38,39,43 20–1573, Osaka, Japan) was emulsified with 0.5% gum arabic and 0.008% tocopherol in distilled water and was administered by gavage using a disposable, flexible feeding tube. 20–1573, Osaka, Japan) was emulsified with 0.5% gum arabic and 0.008% tocopherol in distilled water and was administered by gavage using a disposable, flexible feeding tube. 20–1573, Osaka, Japan) was emulsified with 0.5% gum arabic and 0.008% tocopherol in distilled water and was administered by gavage using a disposable, flexible feeding tube. 20–1573, Osaka, Japan) was emulsified with 0.5% gum arabic and 0.008% tocopherol in distilled water and was administered by gavage using a disposable, flexible feeding tube.

BUN and serum creatinineUpon completion of the in vivo experiments, a whole-blood sample was harvested either from the tail (BUN) or aorta (creatinine). Our results show that Hsp70 promotes renal epithelial cell survival and preserves organ function after ischemia partly by inhibiting proapoptotic changes in the activity of Akt and GSK3β. The collagenase was neutralized with calf serum and the digested cortex was washed twice with buffered F12 medium. Cells were harvested and characterized as proximal tubule in origin as described previously by our laboratory63,64 and were maintained in a 50:50 (vol/vol) mixture of Dulbecco’s modied Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/Ham’s F12 medium containing insulin (5 mg/l), hydro-cortisone (50 nM), and apotransferrin (500 mg/l) and were cultured at 37 °C for 5–7 days in a 5% CO2 incubator. Hsp70 expression was confirmed in cell lysates by immunoblot analysis 24 h after removal of the virus. After blocking with dry milk, membranes were incubated with antibodies directed against Hsp70 (C92F3A-5; Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI), active Bax (YTH-6A7; Trevingen, Gaithersburg, MD) total Bax (YTH-5B7; Trevingen), Bcl2 (Cell Signaling, cat no. Akt-mediated Bax serine184 phosphorylationAkt-mediated phosphorylation of a synthetic Bax peptide was performed as previously described for GSK3β.42 In brief, Akt was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg cell protein by constant mixing with 5 μg of an anti-Akt monoclonal antibody and protein A-sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.3 gene deletion suppresses renal Hsp70 expressionImmunoblot analysis of Hsp70 in renal cortical homogenates confirmed relatively high expression in Hsp70+/+ mice, intermediate expression in Hsp70 +/− mice, and no detectable Hsp70 in Hsp70−/− mice (Figure 1). In addition, 100% of Hsp70−/− and 25% of Hsp70+/− mice died within 72 h after ischemia, whereas all Hsp70+/+ mice survived. In addition, 100% of Hsp70−/− and 25% of Hsp70+/− mice died within 72 h after ischemia, whereas all Hsp70+/+ mice survived.

In addition, 100% of Hsp70−/− and 25% of Hsp70+/− mice died within 72 h after ischemia, whereas all Hsp70+/+ mice survived. Half of the vehicle-treated Hsp70+/+ mice died, whereas all GGA-treated mice survived. Half of the vehicle-treated Hsp70+/+ mice died, whereas all GGA-treated mice survived. Half of the vehicle-treated Hsp70+/+ mice died, whereas all GGA-treated mice survived. Half of the vehicle-treated Hsp70+/+ mice died, whereas all GGA-treated mice survived. The Brown Norway rat, a species with relatively abundant renal Hsp70 expression, is resistant to ischemic AKI.9 In addition, nonspecific agents that induce heat stress proteins reduce ischemic tissue injury, partly by inducing the expression of Hsp70.10–12 Although previous evidence is suggestive, a direct role for Hsp70 in ischemic AKI has not been demonstrated and the mechanism of Hsp70-mediated protection in ischemic tissue injury is controversial. To assess the potential efficacy of GGA in Hsp70−/− mice, the duration of RPO was shortened to 21 min. In Hsp70+/+ mice, brief RPO failed to cause marked tubular injury in the presence or absence of GGA (Figure 3b, panels A vs C). To confirm the efficacy of GGA, Hsp70+/+ mice were subjected to 40 min of RPO, an insult sufficient to produce marked tubular injury and renal dysfunction in these animals.

In the intact kidney as well as in renal epithelial cells subjected to ATP depletion, BCL2 proteins mediate apoptosis by causing mitochondrial membrane injury, resulting in the release of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent factors.14–21 Bax and Bcl2 (proto-type pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, respectively) are the primary mediators of survival after insults that target mitochondria.22,23 Although other BCL2 members likely have ‘supportive roles’ in cell death, Bax and Bcl2 determine the apoptotic ‘set point.’24 Furthermore, maneuvers directed at one or both of these BCL2 proteins alter stress-induced cell death in a predictable fashion.25–29 Several laboratories, including our own, have shown that Hsp70 regulates members of the BCL2 family. Compared with Hsp70+/+mice, active caspase 3 increased by 548±58% and 1597±67% in the renal cortex of Hsp70+/− and Hsp70−/− animals, respectively (P<0.05 vs Hsp70+/+; n =  3).To confirm that Hsp70 per se inhibits Bax and promotes survival, active Bax was colocalized with a mitochondrial marker before and after ATP depletion in cultured primary proximal tubules cells harvested from Hsp70−/− mice in the presence and absence of exogenous Hsp70. Basal-level Akt activity (as measured by p-ser473 Akt content) was similar in Hsp70+/+ and Hsp70−/− renal cortical homogenates (Figure 6a). Basal-level Akt activity (as measured by p-ser473 Akt content) was similar in Hsp70+/+ and Hsp70−/− renal cortical homogenates (Figure 6a). Treatment of ischemic AKI with GGAAs Hsp70 induction by GGA before ischemia ameliorated tubular injury and organ failure, we hypothesized that GGA effectively treats ischemic AKI. GGA treatment also preserved tubular morphology after injury (Figure 7b) and improved animal survival. Of eight vehicle-treated Hsp70 +/+ animals, four (50%) died within 72-h postischemia. Constitutive Bax targeting to the mitochondrial surfaces results from either a single substitution at this site by valine or alanine (Bax-S184V, Bax-S184A) as well as by ser184 deletion (Bax-deltaS184).14,41 None of these Bax mutants is inactivated by Akt and each is highly toxic to mitochondria. Constitutive Bax targeting to the mitochondrial surfaces results from either a single substitution at this site by valine or alanine (Bax-S184V, Bax-S184A) as well as by ser184 deletion (Bax-deltaS184).14,41 None of these Bax mutants is inactivated by Akt and each is highly toxic to mitochondria. This increased sensitivity to death is completely reversed by repletion of Hsp70 to the level detected in wild-type mice (Figure 5b), confirming that Hsp70 is critical for renal epithelial cell survival after stress. At present, it is difficult to study the effect of Hsp70 on Bax serine phosphorylation because of the absence of phospho-specific antibodies and the presence of multiple serine sites with opposing effects on Bax activity.
