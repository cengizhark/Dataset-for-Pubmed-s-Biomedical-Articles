3B).Integrins, especially αvβ3, are important in endothelial cell movement and alignment to shear stress and mechanical stimulation (Davies, 1991; Davies, 1995; Tzima et al , 2001). This endogenous EF guides epithelial cell migration and nerve sprouting directly towards the wound edge, and wound healing is compromised if the EF is inhibited (McCaig et al , 2002; Sta Iglesia and Vanable, 1998; Song et al , 2001; Song et al , 2002). Interestingly, a corneal wound caused by chemical cauterization induces capillaries to sprout and grow directly towards the wound edge (Burger et al , 1983). The elongation response of endothelial cells was more marked than that seen previously at the same EF strengths, in corneal and lens epithelial cells (Zhao et al , 1996). This is a striking response and closely resembles that seen for wound-edge-directed nerve sprouting (Rozsa et al , 1983), which we have shown is guided by the wound-induced EF (McCaig et al , 2002). This is a striking response and closely resembles that seen for wound-edge-directed nerve sprouting (Rozsa et al , 1983), which we have shown is guided by the wound-induced EF (McCaig et al , 2002). This is a striking response and closely resembles that seen for wound-edge-directed nerve sprouting (Rozsa et al , 1983), which we have shown is guided by the wound-induced EF (McCaig et al , 2002). Rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of cells also causes significant changes in cell surface charge (Brent and Forrester, 1967; Elul et al , 1975) and tumors become polarized relative to quiescent surrounding regions. In breast cancer, for example, potential differences between proliferating and non-proliferating regions can be measured at the surface of the skin and are being used diagnostically because they correlate well with malignancy of the neoplasm (Cuzick et al , 1998). Cell migration was quantified as previously (Zhao et al , 1996) and significant anodal migration was evident (P<0.0001) (Fig. Although electric stimulation seems to promise a new approach to promoting angiogenesis in vivo (Kanno et al , 1999; Patterson et al , 1999), the cellular and molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. We have shown that a small physiological EF markedly stimulated release of VEGF from cultured endothelial cells and that the ensuing activation of VEGFRs and associated signaling elements promoted cell elongation, cell reorientation and directed cell migration, all of which are central to angiogenesis. The ζ potentials, for example, are created at the endothelial cell wall by the flow of blood in both the aorta and vena cava, and range from 100 mV to 400 mV (Sawyer et al , 1966). This response might play a role in sensing tissue hypoxia following excessive muscle activation (Hang et al , 1995). Our finding that Rho-p160ROCK is involved in EF-induced cell alignment is in keeping with a similar role in cell alignment in shear stress (Li et al , 1999). Apart from its involvement in Ca2+ regulation, p160ROCK or Rho kinase can enhance the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Kimura et al , 1996). This is interesting, given the common downstream signaling elements shared by cells orienting to shear stress and to a small EF (Chen et al , 1999). EF-induced epithelial cell migration is initiated by EGF receptor signaling (Zhao et al , 2002b; Zhao et al , 1996; Fang et al , 1998). Electrical stimulation to enhance angiogenesis has been heralded as a new chapter in the search for novel approaches to treat ischemia (Kanno et al , 1999; Patterson et al , 1999; Linderman et al , 2000). In the heart, this leads to a flow of injury current, intracellularly through junctionally coupled cells, with an extracellular return loop, and is thought to be involved in arrhythmogenesis (Coronel et al , 1991). This represents a fluctuation within the normal variation of membrane potentials observed in those cells. In 70% of those cells, Vargas et al  (Vargas et al , 1994) observed that a small outward current was activated with a threshold of 0 mV (depolarization of membrane potential), whereas inward rectifying currents were activated with a threshold of 100 mV (hyperpolarization). In other words, small currents at membrane potentials between −100 mV and −20 mV indicate that channels in HUVEC cells were mostly closed in that range (Vargas et al , 1994). Human small cell lung cancer cells and differentiated Dictyostelium ameba for instance, elongate parallel to the EF or showed no preferential orientation (Zhao et al , 2002a).It is interesting to notice the similarity between the appearance of the cells exposed to EFs (Fig. However, it is unlikely that electro-osmotic water movement mediates the effects of a DC EF. In diastole, damaged extracellular areas become negative relative to undamaged areas, and this is reversed in systole, although the currents become more diffuse and are around one-third of their diastolic magnitude (Kleber et al , 1978). 0.011 for culture medium at 37°C), h is the channel height (~200 μm) and b is the channel width (1 cm for our chamber) (Albuquerque et al , 2000; Levesque and Nerem, 1985). Extracellular injury currents, which create directly measured DC EFs of 58 mV cm−1, extend over about 8 mm at the boundary between ischemic and normal tissue (Coronel et al , 1991). The experimentally measured electric fields near the cuts are 40 mV mm−1 and 100–200 mV mm−1 in bovine cornea and guinea-pig skin, respectively (Chiang et al , 1992; Barker et al , 1982). The experimentally measured electric fields near the cuts are 40 mV mm−1 and 100–200 mV mm−1 in bovine cornea and guinea-pig skin, respectively (Chiang et al , 1992; Barker et al , 1982). This might have important implications for understanding angiogenesis and introduce new ways of controlling and engineering angiogenesis. They strikingly direct the orientation, the migration and the axis of division of corneal epithelial cells, for example (Nuccitelli, 1992; McCaig and Zhao, 1997; Song et al , 2002; Robinson, 1985; Zhao et al , 1999b; Zhao et al , 2002a; Zhao et al , 2002b). These were direct effects of the EF. Part of the results have been reported in abstract form (Zhao et al , 2001). The VEGFR inhibitor (catalog number 676475), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (catalog number 440202), the Akt inhibitor (catalog number 124005) and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (catalog number 688001) were all from Calbiochem. Electric field stimulationThe experimental setup and EF exposure protocols were similar to those reported previously (Zhao et al , 1996). Quantification of cell behaviorA series of images was taken with an image analyser immediately before EF exposure and at 4, 8 and 24 hours of EF exposure (Zhao et al , 1996). Cell orientation was quantified as an orientation index (Oi) (Zhao et al , 1996; Erickson and Nuccitelli, 1984), which is defined as Oi=cos2(α), where α is the angle formed by the long axis of a cell with a line drawn perpendicular to the field lines. The significance of this two-dimensional orientation distribution against randomness was calculated using Rayleigh’s distribution (Zhao et al , 1996).

Confocal microscopy was as described (Zhao et al , 1999a). Confocal microscopy was as described (Zhao et al , 1999a). Confocal microscopy was as described (Zhao et al , 1999a). Frequently (perhaps always), it occurs in the presence of directly measured endogenous EFs, which are generated by active ion transport across polarized epithelia and endothelia (Barker et al , 1982; Jaffe and Stern, 1979; Jaffe and Vanable, 1984; Nuccitelli, 1992; Hotary and Robinson, 1992; McCaig and Zhao, 1997; Zhao et al , 1999a). A steady increase of Oi indicates gradually increasing perpendicular orientation with continued exposure (Fig. When the extent of ion pumping or of tissue electrical resistance varies spatially, steady direct-current (DC) EFs arise extracellularly (McCaig et al , 2002). Marked elevation of VEGF in the culture medium was observed as early as 5 minutes after onset of the EF; this was reduced at 1 hour and 2 hours, rose again at 4 hours, and reached a high level by 24 hours (Fig. This drug is a potent VEGFR inhibitor that inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinase activity (50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.0 μM and 100 nM for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, respectively).

This drug is a potent VEGFR inhibitor that inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinase activity (50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.0 μM and 100 nM for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, respectively). It is very selective for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity compared with that associated with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (50-fold and 3800-fold, respectively) (Hennequin et al , 1999).
