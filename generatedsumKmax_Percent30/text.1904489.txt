In addition to a 3-phosphoinositide-binding PX domain (Cozier et al , 2002; Zhong et al , 2002), SNX1 contains a C-terminal BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain (Habermann, 2004; Carlton et al , 2004). In addition to a 3-phosphoinositide-binding PX domain (Cozier et al , 2002; Zhong et al , 2002), SNX1 contains a C-terminal BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain (Habermann, 2004; Carlton et al , 2004). Targeting to these punctae was mediated in part through 3-phosphoinositide-binding as SNX2(K211A) was entirely cytosolic, and wild-type SNX2 dissociated from these structure on incubation with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (100 nM for 10 minutes; data not shown). These in vivo data therefore confirm the in vitro conclusion that SNX2 is incapable of inducing significant membrane tubulation. Significant, but not complete, co-localisation was observed with EEA1 (Fig. It is to be noted that, although the GFP-SNX2 and the EGF receptor signals were observed to decorate the same structures, they rarely overlapped perfectly, appearing more juxtaposed, or polarised at the resolution of light microscopy. It is to be noted that, although the GFP-SNX2 and the EGF receptor signals were observed to decorate the same structures, they rarely overlapped perfectly, appearing more juxtaposed, or polarised at the resolution of light microscopy. Limited co-localisation was observed with LAMP1, a known marker of late endosomes (Fig. Limited co-localisation was observed with LAMP1, a known marker of late endosomes (Fig. In HeLa cells, endogenous SNX1 and SNX2 co-localise on early endosomesIt has recently been reported that, in HeLa cells, SNX1 and SNX2 reside on distinct endosomal structures (Gullapalli et al , 2004). In order to confirm this study we characterised the specificity of a monoclonal antisera raised against SNX2. HeLa cells transiently transfected with control, SNX2-targeted or a specific SNX1 siRNA duplex (the latter having previously been characterised) (Carlton et al , 2004) were incubated for 72 hours prior to probing whole cell lysates with the SNX2 antisera. In yeast, this complex modulates retrieval of Vps10p, the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) receptor, from the prevacuolar endosomal compartment back to the late-Golgi (Seaman et al , 1997; Seaman et al , 1998; Pelham, 2002). Such SNX2-labelled tubular profiles also contained CI-MPR (Fig. Suppression of SNX2 does not significantly affect the degradative sorting of receptors for EGF or transferrinIn an attempt to establish the function of endogenous SNX2 in the sorting of cargo through the endosomal network, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the trafficking of receptors for EGF and transferrin in HeLa cells suppressed for SNX2. In turn, this membrane bound sub-complex associates with another sub-complex composed of Vps26p, Vps29p and Vps35p that is rendered cargo-selective due to the ability of Vps35p to associate with the cytosolic region of Vps10p (Nothwehr et al , 2000; Burda et al , 2002).

With the exception of Vps17p, mammalian orthologues of yeast retromer subunits have been identified (Haft et al , 2000). With the exception of Vps17p, mammalian orthologues of yeast retromer subunits have been identified (Haft et al , 2000). With the exception of Vps17p, mammalian orthologues of yeast retromer subunits have been identified (Haft et al , 2000). A number of independent studies have now provided substantial evidence for an evolutionarily conserved function for the yeast and mammalian retromer complexes in regulating retrieval of TGN resident cargo from endosomes (Horazdovsky et al , 1997; Seaman et al , 1997; Seaman et al , 1998; Arighi et al , 2004; Seaman, 2004; Carlton et al , 2004). However, whereas the BAR domain of SNX1 allows this protein to induce membrane tubulation (Carlton et al , 2004), in vitro and in vivo data suggest that this is not a property shared with the corresponding domain from SNX2. Therefore, there is a real need to analyse the remaining SNX/BAR proteins in order to determine whether SNX1 is unique in sensing membrane curvature and inducing membrane tubulation. With the phosphoinositide-binding profile and membrane-curvature-sensing properties of SNX2, it is perhaps not surprising that this protein co-localises with SNX1 on high curvature tubular elements of the PtdIns(3)P-enriched early endosome.

Furthermore, our analyses of EGF and transferrin receptor trafficking confirm that, when suppressed to the levels shown in this study, SNX1 and SNX2 do not play a functionally redundant role in controlling the degradative sorting of these receptors. Given such a conserved function for retromer, one outstanding issue concerns the identity of the mammalian orthologue of yeast Vps17p. This is of particular interest given the genetic evidence supporting the possibility that SNX1 and SNX2 have distinct functions in mammalian cells (Schwarz et al , 2002). Such data are entirely consistent with the proposed role for SNX2 as the mammalian orthologue of the Vps17p component of the yeast retromer (Haft et al , 2000). In this regard, it is interesting to note that sorting nexin-15 (SNX15) binds SNX1 and has been reported to bind other components of the retromer complex (Barr et al , 2000; Phillips et al , 2001). Like Vps5p and Vps17p (Seaman and Williams, 2002), SNX1 and SNX2 can assemble in vitro and in vivo as homo- and heterodimers (Haft et al , 1998; Kurten et al , 2001). Like Vps5p and Vps17p (Seaman and Williams, 2002), SNX1 and SNX2 can assemble in vitro and in vivo as homo- and heterodimers (Haft et al , 1998; Kurten et al , 2001). A goat anti-SNX1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-CI-MPR was a kind gift from Prof. Paul Luzio (CIMR, Cambridge). Sheep polyclonal anti-TGN46 was from Serotec and mouse monoclonal anti-CD8 was from Alexis. Approximately 500 ng bacterially expressed SNX2 was added per reaction and the association with phosphoinositide-supplemented liposomes was performed as previously described (Cozier et al , 2000; Cozier et al , 2002; Cozier et al , 2003). These values were expressed as a percentage of the total number of fluorescent structures per cell, and the process was repeated for 3–5 individual cells. Processing of cells for ultrathin cryosectioning and double-immuno-labeling according to the protein A-gold method was carried out as described (Slot et al , 1991; Liou et al , 1996, Carlton et al , 2004). By contrast, the CI-MPR is removed from the degradative pathway via retrieval through the endocytic recycling compartment to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Lin et al , 2004). Cells were chased into DHB containing 50 μg/ml cold transferrin for the indicated times. Cells were solubilised with 1 M NaOH at room temperature for 30 minutes and recycled, degraded and internalised counts were collected as for the 125I-transferrin trafficking assays. Coverslips were transferred to a well containing 3 ml of ice cold DHB for 15 minutes to stop trafficking processes. At the assay end point, cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and were fixed at room temperature using 4% (w/v) ice-cold PFA.

Alexa488-fluorescence intensity was calculated using the Leica supplied imaging analysis package, LCSLite. The prototypical family member is sorting nexin-1 (SNX1) (Kurten et al , 1996). Analysis of binding revealed that SNX2 associated primarily with liposomes supplemented with either PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. In addition, weak binding was observed to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate [PtdIns(4)P] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2]: binding to these 4-phosphoinositides was not previously detected in identical assays using SNX1 (Cozier et al , 2002).By titrating down the percentage of PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2, while keeping the total lipid mass constant through addition of phosphatidylinositol, we calculated apparent binding constants K[0.5] – assuming an even distribution of the lipids within the aqueous environment – of 4.4±0.5 and 8.3±0.7 μM for SNX2 binding to PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2, respectively (Fig. Phosphoinositide-binding was a function of the PX domain as SNX2(K211A) – a site-directed mutant targeting a conserved lysine residue known to be required for phosphoinositide-binding to the PX domain of SNX1 (Cozier et al , 2002) – failed to associate with any phosphoinositide (Fig. For SNX1, this domain is required for dimerisation, the ability to sense membrane curvature and to induce membrane tubulation (Carlton et al , 2004).
