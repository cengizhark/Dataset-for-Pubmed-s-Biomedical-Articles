The peak amplitudes of the evoked responses to the first spike on individual trials over 10 minutes (120 trials) are represented as a time plot in Figure 1E. 2C); the average half-width of the uEPSCs was 2.53 ± 1.74 ms with a median of 2.06 ms, (Fig. The correlation between the peak amplitudes of the first and second uEPSC (R2 = 0.97, p < 0.01) is illustrated in Figure 2G. These connections with perfect fidelity of transmission showed a postsynaptic response every time the presynaptic cell produced an action potential, but this does not imply that glutamate release occurred in response to every action potential at all the release sites mediating the connection. Reliable connections were predominant - 17% of the connections had failure rates ≥ 50% with an average failure rate of 25 ± 26% (median = 17%).

Thus, it is of interest to evaluate these parameters independently to separate their respective contributions.

In contrast, the mean value for pairs with responses > 30 pA was 0.85 ± 0.46ms (p < 0.01, Student's t-test). In contrast, the mean value for pairs with responses > 30 pA was 0.85 ± 0.46ms (p < 0.01, Student's t-test). The three different models were statistically compared (see Materials and Methods) in order to find out which most adequately explains the data with the minimal assumptions. The quantal model allows extraction of quantal size (in pA) that corresponds to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter; this model was chosen for 30 of 75 cases (40%). An example is shown in Figure 5B2. An example is shown in Figure 5B2. An example is illustrated in Figure 5B3. An example is illustrated in Figure 5B3. The failure rate of a connection is partially determined by the number of release sites in the connection, such that connections with a higher number of release sites are more reliable.

Connection failure rates spanned the full range, from 0% to 100%. Similarly, we observed a positive correlation between synaptic strength and the number of putative synaptic contacts as determined by anatomical reconstruction of biocytin-filled pairs (gray points in Fig. Short-term plasticity is also correlated with the binomial probability of individual release sites as estimated by quantal analysis (R2=0.41; p<0.01; Fig. 6H) suggesting that the binomial release probability and the overall release probability should correlate, as is the case (R2 = 0.59; p <0.01 Fig. Thus, it is of interest to know to what degree common anatomical elements within such microcircuits (e.g. Thus, it is of interest to know to what degree common anatomical elements within such microcircuits (e.g. Thus, it is of interest to know to what degree common anatomical elements within such microcircuits (e.g. Thus, it is of interest to know to what degree common anatomical elements within such microcircuits (e.g. Slice preparationAll experiments were performed according to guidelines by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine and followed the NIH Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Divergent triplets recorded simultaneouslyIn a subset (n = 7/9) of divergent triplets, both connections were recorded simultaneously, permitting individual trial-by-trial analysis of the responses evoked in two postsynaptic cells by activation of a single presynaptic cell. One example of a simultaneously recorded divergent triplet is shown in Figure 7A. One example of a simultaneously recorded divergent triplet is shown in Figure 7A. One example of a simultaneously recorded divergent triplet is shown in Figure 7A. Note that cell A (top green traces in Fig. Coronal slices of the visual cortex were cut at 300 μm with a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). Coronal slices of the visual cortex were cut at 300 μm with a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). We conclude that as was the case for divergent triplets, convergent triplets do not behave more similarly than expected from random sampling of pairs of L4-L4 connections.

Neurons were visualized with a Zeiss upright microscope (Axioskope FS1; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an Achroplan 40x 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion lens set up for Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.Glass micropipettes (Corning 7056 glass; 1.5 OD, 1.12 ID; A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) were pulled on a vertical puller (PP-830; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to an open tip resistance of 2.5−4.0 MΩ and filled with a pipette solution containing (in mM) 115 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 4 phosphocreatine-Na, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 by KOH. This did not necessarily have to be the case, as neurotransmitter release probability and potency may not be inter-dependent (Stevens and Wang, 1994). Thus, probabilities across release sites may not always be uniform, perhaps due to differences in presynaptic densities or readily releasable pools (Harris and Sultan, 1995), vesicle fusion machinery (Augustin et al , 1999; Rosenmund et al , 2002; Yang et al , 2002), or activity histories.Our anatomical (n=9) and quantal analysis (n=75) estimates for the average number of release sites agree with each other (4.11±4.56 and 4.29±2.02, respectively) and are close to previous estimates for L4 connections to other L4 (6.6±2.1 – Cowan and Stricker, 2004; 3.4±1.0 - Feldmeyer et al , 1999) and to L2/3 (4.5±0.5 - Feldmeyer et al , 2002; 5.1±0.9 - Silver et al , 2003) cells, although our results suggest that the range of N might be greater than previously thought (Fig. This is in contrast with previous estimates of release probabilities at individual L4-L4 sites (rat S1, average Pr=79±2% – Silver et al , 2003; cat V1 range of Pr=68−98% - Tarczy-Hornoch et al , 1999). Thalamocortical projections primarily innervate dendrites within layer 4 (L4) (Friedlander and Martin, 1989; Friedlander et al , 1991; Stratford et al , 1996; Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997; Gil et al , 1999; Erisir and Dreusicke, 2005). The difference in connectivity would have to be several orders of magnitude greater than in rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al , 1999; Cowan and Stricker, 2004) and cat V1 (Tarczy-Hornoch et al , 1999; Binzegger et al , 2004) to account for our low proportion (<2%) of spiny stellates. It is unlikely that late development of spiny stellates was a factor because we used guinea pigs (which are more precocious than other rodents - Rice et al , 1985) in their second postnatal week, when spiny stellates are abundant within L4 in other preparations such as rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al , 1999; Schubert et al , 2003; Feldmeyer et al , 2005). However, under voltage clamp, limited effective space clamp restricts the accuracy of similar analysis of uEPSCs (Wiliams and Mitchell, 2008). All the putative anatomical synaptic contacts that we observed were located on proximal basilar dendrites (distance range = 33−151 μm from the soma; n=9 connected pairs). Such putative contacts are often anatomically verifiable synapses (93% - Silver et al , 2003; 86% - Lubke et al , 2003) although other studies suggest the proportion may be much smaller (32%; DaCosta and Martin, 2007). Excitatory L4 neurons in guinea pig V1 have ∼2500 spines (see Results). About 125 (36%) of these connections would be expected to show relatively high failure rates (>30%).

After overnight fixation, sections were incubated in an avidin/biotin/HRP complex overnight at 4°C with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Vector Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed using DAB (Vector Laboratories).

Cells with membrane potentials more positive than −60 mV and recordings with high access resistance (>40 MΩ or >20% the value of the input resistance for that cell) were discarded. We chose to record the unitary synaptic currents under voltage clamp (vs. recording synaptic potentials under current clamp) for better signal to noise and detection of small events for quantal analysis. Intracortical information processing has serial and parallel components (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Gilbert, 1983, 1993; Callaway, 1998; Martin, 2002; Thomson and Bannister, 2003), through vertical interlaminar and horizontal intralaminar projections (Lund et al , 1979; Ahmed et al , 1994; Lubke et al , 2000). Analyses were performed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and R 2.71 (R Development Core Team; Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A full account of the analysis methods used in this study has been described in others’ studies (Stricker and Redman, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004). The resulting fit was considered as a “model peak” which accounts for intracellular and experimental noise. The resulting fit was considered as a “model peak” which accounts for intracellular and experimental noise. Following current models of synaptic transmission in the cortex, the observed uEPSC response distribution was assumed to be due to a real fluctuation of the response between a number of possible discrete amplitudes (due to probabilistic release at an unknown number of release sites) superimposed with recording and intracellular noise.

Although the properties of intralaminar synaptic connections in visual cortex within supragranular and infragranular layers have been studied (Markram et al , 1997; Mercer et al , 2005; Song et al , 2005; Feldmeyer et al , 2006; Hardingham et al , 2007), less is known about the functional synaptic properties within L4 in visual cortex (Stratford et al , 1996; Tarczy-Hornoch et al , 1999), although these connections represent a substantial fraction of the synapses within L4.

This initial fit was the unconstrained model, since no restrictions were imposed on the locations or weights of the peaks. Once this optimal K was obtained, a quantal model (in which the peaks are forced to be equally distanced by a separation q, corresponding to the quantal content of a synaptic vesicle) was fit to the uEPSC PDF and compared to the unconstrained model. In this way, every analyzed synaptic connection was assigned to one of three models (unconstrained, quantal or binomial) and a different number of synaptic parameters were extracted depending on the model: number of peaks, failure rate, quantal size q (for quantal and binomial connections) and release probability p (for binomial connections). There are several possibilities for this difference including the species used (guinea pig vs. rat), possible differences between connectivity of spiny stellates (Lubke et al , 2000) and pyramidal neurons (our study) or the search protocol. Thus, in many cases, we were simply not able to adequately evaluate the reciprocal connection, making our estimates a lower bound on the number of reciprocal connected pairs.
