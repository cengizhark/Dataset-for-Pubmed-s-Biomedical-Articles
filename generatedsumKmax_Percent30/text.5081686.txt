(2) In addition, there was no significant trend in PFD prevalence over the 5-year period. (3) In examining risk factors for PFDs, older age was the most significant risk factor with over 50% of women over the age of 80 having one or more PFD. We estimated that the combined prevalence of UI was 17.1% (95% CI 15.8–18.4),(2) which is similar to Nygaard et al  who estimated the prevalence of UI to be 15.7%. We estimated that the combined prevalence of UI was 17.1% (95% CI 15.8–18.4),(2) which is similar to Nygaard et al  who estimated the prevalence of UI to be 15.7%. (2, 4, 6)Data are mixed regarding the prevalence of UI across racial/ethnic groups. (2, 10, 11*) In the Nurses’ Health Study of more than 64,000 women, the prevalence of dual UI and FI was 7.2%. (13*) Risk factors for dual incontinence include older age, depression, co-morbidities, diarrhea, multiparity, and hysterectomy. (1, 2) In a review article published as part of the Fifth International Collaboration on Incontinence, Barber et al  found that symptomatic POP was present in 3–6% of the population, but when based on vaginal examination was present in up to 50%. In addition to parity and vaginal delivery, non-obstetric risk factors for POP surgery include age, constipation, increasing weight, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to parity and vaginal delivery, non-obstetric risk factors for POP surgery include age, constipation, increasing weight, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to parity and vaginal delivery, non-obstetric risk factors for POP surgery include age, constipation, increasing weight, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (23, 24) After these FDA notices, several studies have evaluated trends in the use of mesh for POP. (23, 24) After these FDA notices, several studies have evaluated trends in the use of mesh for POP. (29, 30) From 2000–2009, there was a dramatic decrease in SUI retropubic procedures with a corresponding increase in sling procedures in the U.S. Data from other countries, including England(31), Taiwan(32) and Korea,(33) show similar trends.

Overall Pelvic Floor DisordersNygaard and colleagues demonstrated the significant public health burden of PFDs in their landmark study in 2008. Over the next 40 years, the United States will experience significant growth in its aging population. Annual procedure rates will increase from 210,700 to 310,050 for SUI and from 166,000 to 245,970 for POP. Annual procedure rates will increase from 210,700 to 310,050 for SUI and from 166,000 to 245,970 for POP. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2006 the authors found that 23.7% of U.S. women had at least one PFD. (39) Using past clinic data, the authors estimated the demand for care for PFDs would increase by 35% from 2010 to 2030. (39**) Taken together both studies indicate that a significant increase in both the number of women with PFDs and those seeking care for PFDs will occur over the next 20 to 40 years. Pelvic floor disorders are a significant public health issue affecting the lives of millions of adult women. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. This increased demand for PFD treatment and care in the future will lead to a greater need for providers properly trained in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, the newest board-certified subspecialty within the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
