HMO-based community practice comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies, juxtaposed relative to SEER-Medicare studies, can provide needed data that may be more generalizable than clinical trial data where strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized treatment protocols limit the populations under study. In each of these health plans, the majority of cancer care was delivered by salaried physicians in plan-owned facilities. The VDW pharmacy and infusion files capture National Drug Code (NDC) based prescription drugs dispensed from both outpatient pharmacies and infusion centers. VDW Death data are derived from the tumor registries, membership data, state level (CA, CO, OR, WA) death datasets, and data from the Social Security Administration. Study SampleThe study sample included patients identified in the VTR as aged 21 years and older, diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC between 01/01/2002 and 12/31/2010, and followed through December 31, 2011. Study SampleThe study sample included patients identified in the VTR as aged 21 years and older, diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC between 01/01/2002 and 12/31/2010, and followed through December 31, 2011. Patients with concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, defined as start dates within 14 days of each other, were excluded. Survival OutcomesThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality, defined as the number of months from the start of first-line chemotherapy until death. For patients diagnosed after 2005, we also captured other known pre-treatment negative predictor factors or possible exclusion criteria for BCP treatment6 including bleeding, thrombosis, use of anti-coagulants, brain metastasis, active cardio-vascular disease, etc. Medians and interquartile ranges of time to death were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups with log rank tests.20 Given that one goal of this study was to juxtapose CRN VDW findings relative to those derived using SEER-Medicare data, we used models consistent with those described in Zhu et al,12 we initially estimated unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for similar baseline characteristics, to evaluate the effect of the addition of bevacizumab on survival. For the negative predictor factors that were noted as exclusion criteria in the original ECOG4599 trial,6 statistically significant differences in three criteria or diagnoses were noted between the BCP and CP2005 groups. These findings were robust to the model specification of using only patients diagnosed prior to 2010 (i.e., all patients had the opportunity for at least 2 years of follow-up).Controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics in the multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, we also found that relative to CP2005 or CP2002, that BCP was associated with a consistent protective effect, with hazard ratios of less than 1.0, in all sub-analyses including those limited to age less than 65, age 65 years and older, females only, stage IV, and to patients with no comorbidities. Similarly, for patients age 65 years and older, relative to CP2005 and CP2002, the estimated hazard ratios associated with BCP were 0.74 (95% CI 0.54–1.00), and 0.64 (95% CI 0.46–0.88).As noted in Table 4, when the propensity score models comparing BCP to CP2005 were re-estimated to include the negative predictor factors for BCP that were noted as exclusion criteria in the ECOG4599 trial,6 the results noted above held. Similarly, for patients age 65 years and older, relative to CP2005 and CP2002, the estimated hazard ratios associated with BCP were 0.74 (95% CI 0.54–1.00), and 0.64 (95% CI 0.46–0.88).As noted in Table 4, when the propensity score models comparing BCP to CP2005 were re-estimated to include the negative predictor factors for BCP that were noted as exclusion criteria in the ECOG4599 trial,6 the results noted above held. Similarly, for patients age 65 years and older, relative to CP2005 and CP2002, the estimated hazard ratios associated with BCP were 0.74 (95% CI 0.54–1.00), and 0.64 (95% CI 0.46–0.88).As noted in Table 4, when the propensity score models comparing BCP to CP2005 were re-estimated to include the negative predictor factors for BCP that were noted as exclusion criteria in the ECOG4599 trial,6 the results noted above held. With exception of the propensity score stabilized IPTW models, the addition of bevacizumab again, showed a statistically significant protective effect with the estimated hazard ratios associated with BCP for the multivariable-adjusted model, the propensity score adjusted model, and the propensity score matching model of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.98), 0.82 (95% CI 0.66–0.999), and 0.63 (95% CI 0.45–0.89), respectively.When all multivariate and propensity score adjusted models and subgroup analyses were re-estimated separately for patients less than 65 years and patients 65 years and older, we found similar results (See Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, available on-line). Relative to the earlier CP2002 group, the protective survival effect was statistically significant for both age stratifications in all adjusted models except for the propensity score matched sample. Our findings echo the results of the ECOG 4599 trial, where bevacizumab was found to improve overall survival in the studied population. To the contrary, our data shows fairly robust benefit that closely approximates the survival curves seen in ECOG 4599.6 To the contrary, our data shows fairly robust benefit that closely approximates the survival curves seen in ECOG 4599.6 To the contrary, our data shows fairly robust benefit that closely approximates the survival curves seen in ECOG 4599.6 Inasmuch as these results approximate results seen from a large randomized controlled trial, we believe this validates the use of these tools for future health outcomes and comparative effectiveness research.

Our findings also complement the sub-group analysis from ECOG 4599 and the work of Zhu and colleagues who found that BCP was not associated with better survival among Medicare-aged patients with advanced NS-NSCLC.12 While our estimated hazard ratios for patients age 65 years and older were consistently less than 1.0, our estimates did not reach statistical significance in all models. Consistent with the SEER-Medicare study, elderly patients who received BCP (versus CP) in the HMO/CRN setting were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV disease. Consistent with the SEER-Medicare study, elderly patients who received BCP (versus CP) in the HMO/CRN setting were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV disease. While our findings are somewhat inconclusive regarding bevacizumab in older patients, probably due to the small sample size, they do suggest that in conjunction with the results from the original ECOG 4599 trial, the Yang et al  meta-analysis,29 and the Zhu et al 12 comparative effectiveness study, that consideration may be needed when the question of whether to prescribe bevacizumab in an elderly patient presents itself. In addition, with the exception of tumor registry data, all diagnostic data used in this study were derived from coded medical recorded and claims data; not manual chart abstraction.
