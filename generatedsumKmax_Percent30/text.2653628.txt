Instead, the decreased number of αSM-actin positive perivascular cells was consistent with reduced proliferation as assessed by PCNA staining (arrows in Fig. 4B-b,d) showed brain compression and collapse of telancephalic vesicles. These defects were apparent in H&E stained transverse sections of the heads at multiple levels (Fig. We observed similar brain vessel distribution in the WT and flox/flox mutants at E9.5 (data not shown), however, at E10.5, we noted evidence of clearing of telancephalic vessels in the WT (Fig. 4C-b,d).Transverse sections of the PECAM stained brains at the level of the nasal-mandibullar processes showed histologic evidence of clearing of vessels in the WT heads (Fig. In this study, we determined whether VSMC-deletion of Bmpr1a could cause abnormalities in vasculogenesis that might explain a propensity to PAH. 4C-k) (*P<0.05).Since pericytes express SM22α (Ding et al , 2004), we speculated that loss of Bmpr1a in these cells led to resistance to apoptosis and reduced clearing of brain microvessels. We therefore performed fluorescent TUNEL assay followed by fluorescent immunostaining towards NG2, a pericyte marker. We therefore performed fluorescent TUNEL assay followed by fluorescent immunostaining towards NG2, a pericyte marker. Persistence of brain microvessels was not due to enhanced cell growth, since PCNA immunoreactivity showed no difference between E10.5 WT and flox/flox mutants (Fig.4C-l).

Persistence of brain microvessels was not due to enhanced cell growth, since PCNA immunoreactivity showed no difference between E10.5 WT and flox/flox mutants (Fig.4C-l). We also assessed transcript levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN), a known gene downstream of BMP signaling implicated in juvenile polyposis (He et al , 2004) that might also impact cell growth (Beck and Carethers, 2007).

Progeny homozygous for deletion of Bmpr1a SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox died soon after E11 with massive vascular and pericardial hemorrhage. Progeny homozygous for deletion of Bmpr1a SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox died soon after E11 with massive vascular and pericardial hemorrhage. We then used RNAi to reduce mRNA levels of MMP-2 in HBVP and confirmed the decrease in pro and active forms of MMP-2 by gelatin zymography (P<0.001) (Fig. Bmp10-null mice also develop hearts with hypoplastic walls owing to reduced proliferation of cardiomycocytes at E9.0-E9.5 (Chen et al , 2004). Dilatation of the aorta was observed in embryos with FLK1-Bmpr1a deletion (FLK1-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox) (Park et al , 2006) and in Alk1 (Oh et al , 2000) and Smad5 (Yang et al , 1999) null embryos. Since FLK1 is a mesodermal marker and Alk1 is mostly expressed in EC, the angiogenic defect in the yolk sac is likely due to the loss of Bmpr1a in EC, a feature we reproduced by ablating Bmpr1a using Tie2-Cre (our unpublished observations). In addition, mice that are null for MMP-9 are resistant to elastase-induced aortic aneurysms (Pyo et al , 2000). In addition, mice that are null for MMP-9 are resistant to elastase-induced aortic aneurysms (Pyo et al , 2000). In addition, mice that are null for MMP-9 are resistant to elastase-induced aortic aneurysms (Pyo et al , 2000). It is interesting that the MMP-2/-9 double nulls (Lambert et al , 2003) do not recapitulate our phenotype. It is interesting that the MMP-2/-9 double nulls (Lambert et al , 2003) do not recapitulate our phenotype. F2 breeding was then realized by backcrossing F1 mice (SM22α-Cre;R26R+/-;Bmpr1aflox/+) with the Bmpr1aflox/flox;R26R+/+ mice to produce mice that are SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox (flox/flox). Indeed, we showed that lack of Bmpr1a or MMP-2 by RNAi renders pericytes in culture resistant to apoptosis.The same phenomenon might explain the enhanced ramification of the interlimb vessels seen in the flox/flox mutants suggesting that vascular deletion of Bmpr1a might impair organogenesis of other tissues not investigated. To assess apoptosis, we performed the Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End-Labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Oligo Ligation Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, S7200). Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was extracted from whole E9.5 embryos or from HPASMC or HBVP and then reverse transcribed as previously reported (El-Bizri et al , 2008). The gelatinolytic activities were detected as transparent bands against the background of Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gelatin and quantified using ImageJ. Statistical AnalysisValues for each determination are expressed as mean±s.e.m.. For comparisons made to assess two groups, statistical significance was determined using the unpaired two-tailed t-Test. Various germline mutations in Bmpr2 have been identified in familial and even sporadic forms of the disease (Deng et al , 2000; Lane et al , 2000; Thomson et al , 2001).

Cre activity was evident in the heart from E8.5 (data not shown) by blue LacZ staining and in the heart and vasculature at E9.25 (Fig. 1C-d vs. WT in c), and at E11, the mice showed massive perivascular and pericardial hemorrhage (Fig. The cardiac phenotype was not due to enhanced apoptosis as only the occasional TUNEL positive cell was seen (Fig. The cardiac phenotype was not due to enhanced apoptosis as only the occasional TUNEL positive cell was seen (Fig. The cardiac phenotype was not due to enhanced apoptosis as only the occasional TUNEL positive cell was seen (Fig. Our results showed no difference in immunoreactivity between mutant (Fig. Vascular Defect in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox Embryos: Dilatation of Large Vessels Associated with Reduced Proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle CellsTo characterize the vascular defect resulting in perivascular hemorrhage and lethality in flox/flox embryos, we performed whole-mount PECAM staining on embryos at E10.5.

Figure 3A also showed more ramifications or interconnections in the interlimb vessels of the flox/flox (e) vs. WT (f) embryos. Transverse H&E stained sections of E10.5 embryos showed dilated aortae (Fig. Transverse H&E stained sections of E10.5 embryos showed dilated aortae (Fig. Mice homozygous null for Bmpr2 (Beppu et al , 2000), Bmpr1a (Mishina et al , 1995), the ligand Bmp4 (Winnier et al , 1995), and the effector Smad4 (Sirard et al , 1998) die early in embryonic life for lack of mesodermal induction.
