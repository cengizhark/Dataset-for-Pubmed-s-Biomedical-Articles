Furthermore screams compared to yawns activated bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC), right supplementary motor area (SMA) and left middle cingulate cortex (p<0.05, FWE corrected, Table 3). As neither incongruence nor congruence effects were found in the amygdala, a small volume correction (based on the coordinates by Dolan et al , 2001; x=−20, y=−8, z=−14 Talairach coordinates converted into MNI space x=−20, y=−8, z=−17; search volume 6 mm) was carried out for both congruence and incongruence effects.

The results revealed an influence of screams on the perception of fearful and neutral faces and incongruence effects of emotional valence were found in middle cingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, right supplementary motor area (SMA) and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Studies focusing on the neural correlates of audiovisual integration independent of a potential conflict, consistently report increased activation of posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) (Beauchamp, 2005; Kreifelts et al , 2007; Pourtois et al , 2005; Robins et al , 2009), for both emotional and non-emotional integration. Increased activation in occipital areas (Britton et al , 2006), insula (Britton et al , 2006; Chen et al , 2009) and thalamus (Dolan et al , 1996) for happy faces are well in accordance with previous results.In contrast, on the FWE correction level, fearful faces did not recruit more activation in any areas compared to neutral faces. This reflects the relative moderate expression of fear in the fearful face condition and goes along with the less intense rating of these faces after scanning.Comparing laughs and screams to yawns activated bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is in line with previous findings on emotional vs. neutral vocalizations (Fecteau et al , 2007; Meyer et al , 2005; Phillips et al , 1998). Context effects on ratings of facial affectOnly two studies (de Gelder and Vroomen, 2000; Ethofer et al , 2006) previously investigated how emotional sounds influence the perception of (emotional) facial expressions. This higher saliency fits well with the biological perspective that screams, as threat signals, are far more important for survival than laughs (Calder et al , 2001; Green and Phillips, 2004) and is further-more reflected by the more widespread activation evoked by these (as described above). Crossmodal emotional conflict thus recruits a network similar to those previously described to be involved in unimodal emotional and cognitive conflict and attentional control (Botvinick et al , 2004; Corbetta et al , 2008; Ochsner et al , 2009; Wittfoth et al , 2010).The (anterior) cingulate cortex (ACC) has repeatedly been linked to conflict monitoring (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter et al , 1998; Carter and van Veen, 2007) and has been found by Ochsner et al  (2009) and Egner et al  (2008) for cognitive and affective conflict in the visual domain and by Wittfoth et al  (2010) for auditory emotional conflict. As this region has already been demonstrated to respond to unimodal (Egner et al , 2008; Ochsner et al , 2009; Wittfoth et al , 2010) and non-emotional audiovisual (Weissman et al , 2004) conflict, current findings in emotional audiovisual conflict provide further evidence for a generalized role of the dorsal middle cingulate cortex in conflict monitoring and attentional control, irrespectively of modality, integration demands or affective content. Like these authors we would conclude that higher SMA activity may reflect increased executive control needed to select an adequate response in the presence of conflicting (emotional) stimuli.The TPJ, finally, has been implicated in predictive coding (Jakobs et al , 2009), attentional reorienting, theory of mind and perspective taking tasks (Corbetta et al , 2008; Derntl et al , 2010; Mitchell, 2008). Consequently, if the TPJ integrates sensory signals and against the expectations on these, the prediction error between bottom-up facial information and expectation built on the sound may underlie the greater TPJ activation in the incongruent condition.In summary, audiovisual emotional incongruence leads to activation of a cingulate-fronto-parietal network previously shown to be involved in conflict monitoring and resolution (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter et al , 1998; Ochsner et al , 2009; Weissman et al , 2004; Wittfoth et al , 2010). Firstly, we would argue for a role of the TPJ in processing temporally asynchronous conflicting information by integrating predictions and incoming stimuli (Jakobs et al , 2009).

Amunts et al , 2005; Eickhoff et al , 2005). In this context, however, it is important to note, that while smoothing blurs the data, it should per se not affect localisation accuracy (Fox et al , 2001). In this context, however, it is important to note, that while smoothing blurs the data, it should per se not affect localisation accuracy (Fox et al , 2001). Rather spatial uncertainty in neuroimaging results mainly derives from inter-individual variability and imprecision in spatial normalisation (Eickhoff et al , 2009; Grachev et al , 1999; Hellier et al , 2003). This approach has the advantage of avoiding influences of non-linear distortions between EPI and T1 images and yields a precise registration of the functional data into MNI space (see supplementary Fig. From studies in macaque monkeys it is known that the laterobasal amygdala receives direct input from auditory and visual cortices (McDonald, 1998; Yukie, 2002). Moreover feedback projections from the basal nucleus of the amygdala to sensory-associative areas have been demonstrated (Amaral et al , 2003; Yukie, 2002).

Moreover feedback projections from the basal nucleus of the amygdala to sensory-associative areas have been demonstrated (Amaral et al , 2003; Yukie, 2002). Information processing in visual and auditory areas is then modulated via the feedback projections from the laterobasal amygdala to early sensory cortices providing a route for enhancing behaviourally relevant and suppressing less important information. Ultimately, integrating a neutral stimulus into the evaluation by the amygdala should then lead to top-down inhibition in associative visual and auditory areas whereas emotional stimuli in both modalities induce top-down facilitation by the amygdala as evident from significantly higher activation in the purely emotional conditions in lingual gyrus, calcarine sulcus, STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Moreover, the posterior superior temporal sulcus plays also a crucial role in audiovisual integration (Beauchamp, 2005; Campanella and Belin, 2007). Finally, clinical studies in patients with depression show that this disorder goes along with a negativity bias (Drevets et al , 2008) and problems inhibiting negative information (Goeleven et al , 2006; Joormann, 2010). These problems have repeatedly been linked to dysregulation in ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala (Abler et al , 2007; Drevets, 2000; Fales et al , 2008). Hence, 35 healthy right-handed volunteers (20 females; mean age 29.4 ± 8.1 years, mean education 14.1 ± 3.2, 15 males; mean age 34.0 ± 13.3, mean education 14.5 ± 3.2) were included in the analysis.

Rather, most of the time a face is perceived in a particular context, for instance, we see a face in a specific scene or accompanied by a particular sound. Men and women did not significantly differ in age (t33 = 1.29, ns.) Men and women did not significantly differ in age (t33 = 1.29, ns.) All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were right handed as confirmed by the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). The structured clinical interview of DSM IV (SCID; Wittchen et al , 1997) was used to screen the subjects revealing no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders including substance abuse. StimuliThe visual stimuli, obtained from the FEBA inventory (Gur et al , 2002a), consisted of color pictures of male and female faces, showing either a happy, neutral or fearful expression. In total 10 (5 males and 5 females) faces of different actors each showing every expression (happy, neutral, fear) were used. Concurrently with the sound a blurred neutral face was shown. Concurrently with the sound a blurred neutral face was shown. Moreover the TAS-D (Bagby et al , 1994) was carried out to control for alexithymia and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Hautzinger et al , 2006) to check for subclinical depressive symptoms.

Non-emotional conflict has been studied extensively using behavioural and neuroimaging experiments (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter et al , 1998; Carter and van Veen, 2007; Durston et al , 2003; Egner and Hirsch, 2005; Kerns et al , 2004; MacDonald et al , 2000; Ochsner et al , 2009; Weissman et al , 2004). The resulting parameters of a discrete cosine transform, which define the deformation field necessary to move the subjects data into the space of the MNI tissue probability maps, were then combined with the deformation field transforming between the latter and the MNI single subject template. The ensuing deformation was subsequently applied to the individual EPI volumes that were hereby transformed into the MNI single subject space and resampled at 2×2×2 mm3 voxel size. The results of these studies have led to the conflict monitoring hypothesis, which suggests that conflict is detected by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which in turn recruits prefrontal regions to increase cognitive control (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter and van Veen, 2007; Kerns et al , 2004). The resulting SPM (T) maps were then thresholded at p <0.05, correcting for multiple comparisons by controlling the family-wise error (FWE) rate according to the theory of Gaussian random fields (Worsley et al , 1996). The threshold is then chosen as to control the family-wise error rate at p <0.05, i.e., in only one of twenty analyses of random fields of the same type, size and smoothness one would expect to find a single voxel above the chosen threshold.Additionally, another model was estimated where the nine conditions and responses and BDI-scores as a covariate were modeled.Ensuing activations were anatomically localised using version 1.6b of the SPM Anatomy toolbox (Eickhoff et al , 2005, 2006, 2007; www.fz-juelich.de/ime/spm_anatomy_toolbox).
