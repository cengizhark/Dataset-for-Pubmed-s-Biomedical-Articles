StomachSimilar to the esophagus, the gastric microbiome was thought to be non-existent due to the acidic nature of the stomach and presence of proteolytic enzymes.15 However, many studies have refuted those beliefs, showing the stomach has its own unique microbiome, quite different than the oral cavity and esophageal microbiome. Modulators of Microbiome in HealthAmong healthy individuals, certain factors such as age, culture, and geographic differences have shown variations in different parts of the microbiome.15,22 For example, one study has shown the presence of halophilic bacteria and soil bacteria, attributed to the consumption of salted or fermented food unique to a culture.16 Diet has also been shown to be an important modulator of the gut microbiota.23 A study examining children raised in a rural setting were found to have unique microbiome changes compared to children of the same ethnicity but raised in a more urban setting.24 High fiber, low fat diets were found to create an environment that promoted proper digestion, nutrient uptake, and healthy metabolism.21 Healthy habits and good hygiene help maintain an equilibrium in our microbiome.25–27 Disruptions such as dietary changes, poor hygiene, medications, and toxin ingestion such as tobacco and alcohol, can disrupt the equilibrium and increase susceptibility to different diseases.27–29 These imbalances lead to pH changes or alter the inflammatory response, increasing likelihood of non-commensal microbial colonization.In addition to modifiable factors, certain diseases lead to alterations in the human microbiome. Numerous studies demonstrate that PPI use is associated with composition changes of gut microbiomes and decreased microbiome diversity throughout the GI tract (Table 1).16,51,52 PPIs act directly on the proton pumps in the stomach, leading to changes in the acidic environment, which may adversely affect the natural microenvironments of commensal bacteria. There is limited data regarding the impact of PPI use on the oral microbiome. PPI use was associated with an increase in Micrococcocacae, Actinomycetaceae, and Clostridiaceae and a decrease in Comamonadaceae.35 Another has shown an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria.55 In addition to the esophageal microbiome, there has also been associations with the gastric microbiome, with an increase in Streptococcaceae and decrease in Prevotellaceae.

It is thought that the high gastric pH gives rise to a significant increase in oral bacteria in the stomach, such as such as Pepto-streptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus anginosus, Parvimonas micra, Slackia exigua and Dialister pneumosintes.56 A separate study in 2019 by Yi-Chao Shi et al examined the association between PPI use and microbiota in GERD patients versus healthy controls and found that PPI use in GERD patients had lowered relative bacterial diversity of gastric microbiota.16 They reported higher abundances of Planococcaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Sphingomonadaceae in the gastric microbiota with PPI use in GERD patients, and decreased abundance of Desulfuromonadaceae and Shewanellaceae compared to non-PPI users. One study suggested that the microbiota dysbiosis is a potential side effect of the acidic environment caused by GERD.55 However, another study suggests that the bacterial shift towards Gram-negative bacteria could be an indication that dysbiosis is the cause of various GI disorders.57 In addition, chronic inflammation has been demonstrated to play a role in the development of various GI disorders such as BE and EAC.22,58–60 One proposed mechanism suggests that chronic inflammation induced alterations in gut microbiota further contribute to disease development.21,61 A review by Corning and colleagues highlighted that GERD consistently produces a shift in the microbiome and demonstrates an increasing number of Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.14 It has been proposed that bacterial antigens specific to Gram-negative bacteria, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), may promote tissue inflammation via induced expression of NF-κβ, a signaling pathway involved in inflammation.62,63 Activation of NF-κβ has been demonstrated to induce production of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). With a greater understanding on mechanism of progression of GERD and its relation to gut microbiome, future novel targets targeting these pathways may be developed in potential prevention and therapy for GERD.
