Growth factor and cytokine content were assessed using a quantitative multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) proteomics microarray (RayBiotech, Inc, Norcross, GA). To compare the potency of the signaling molecules within each membrane, the extracted protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the growth factor and cytokine loads were normalized to the total extracted protein from either amnion or chorion. These membranes are especially suited for chronic wound healing, because they are known to naturally address many of the contributing factors of chronic wound development, including suppressing dysregulated/uncontrolled inflammatory responses, increasing levels of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors in the wound environment, stimulating proliferation and migration of important cell types, and promoting angiogenesis.2–4 Most commercially available membrane products are processed by dehydration or lyophilization, which alter those characteristics to varying degrees, and the layers included in these grafts vary with most containing a double-layer amnion, amnion and chorion, or the amnion layer alone. Fresh chorion contained more growth factors and cytokines per cm2 compared with amnion, likely due to the overall increased thickness compared with amnion. While previous studies have evaluated the cytokine content within the placental membrane for specific commercial products6–9 and have investigated the effects of processing on the amnion,10,11 there is a lack of literature comparing the cytokine content of the amnion and chorion and evaluating how these tissues are altered by dehydration. The purpose of this study is to compare the growth factor and cytokine content found within the amnion and chorion layers and to determine the effects of dehydration on these signaling molecules. Future studies will focus on the evaluation of other growth factors/cytokines of interest, the use of mechanistic studies on key cell types to evaluate the effect of processing and sterilization on the bioactivity of growth factors and cytokines within membranes, and the clinical relevance of these findings. Fresh chorion contained more of some signaling molecules per cm2 compared with amnion, and both dehydrated samples saw a significant drop in total growth factor and cytokine content (51.1% ± 20.2% for amnion; 55.5% ± 37.3% for chorion).
