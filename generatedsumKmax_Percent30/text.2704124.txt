To differentiate these possibilities, we conducted MTS and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays. To differentiate these possibilities, we conducted MTS and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays. To differentiate these possibilities, we conducted MTS and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays. For the MTS assay, 104 cells/well of wt and Atf4−/− BMSCs were seeded in 96-well plate and were cultured in proliferation medium for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Cell numbers were then measured as described previously [Singha et al , 2007]. As shown in Figure 1D, [3H] thymidine incorporation into the DNA of Atf4−/− BMSCs was decreased by fourfold compared to values in wt cells (P<0.05, wt vs. Atf4−/−). As shown in Figure 2A, in wt calvariae, periosteal osteoblasts proliferated very actively with 60% of the total cells being BrdU-positive. This siRNA specifically targets mouse Atf4 mRNA [Adams, 2007; Yu et al , 2008a]. As shown in Figure 5A, levels of Atf4 mRNA were efficiently reduced by Atf4 siRNA in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Figure 5A, levels of Atf4 mRNA were efficiently reduced by Atf4 siRNA in a dose-dependent manner. For example, formation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex in early to mid G1 phase activates the kinases that phosphorylate and inactivate the tumor suppressor Rb, a critical step that is necessary for the transition from G1 to S phase [Kato et al , 1994; Sherr, 1994; Zhao et al , 2001]. As an initial step to determine if ATF4 regulates apoptosis in BMSCs, wt and Atf4−/− cells were cultured in proliferation media for 4 days and stained by the Hoechst method [Yamanaka et al , 2003]. As shown in Figure 8A–C, the numbers of apoptotic cells including those with shrinking cytoplasm and chromatin condensation (early apoptosis) and DNA fragmentation (late apoptosis) were increased greater than fivefold in Atf4−/− BMSCs compared to wt cells (P< 0.05, wt vs. Atf4−/−). Previous studies established that ATF4 is critical for osteoblast differentiation as demonstrated by dramatically reduced expression of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein mRNA in ATF4-deficient mice [Yang et al , 2004]. Cyclin A1 activates CDK2 and is essential at the G1/S boundary and throughout S phase [Pagano et al , 1992]. The present study demonstrates an essential role for ATF4 in the regulation of BMSC and osteoblast proliferation. The present study demonstrates an essential role for ATF4 in the regulation of BMSC and osteoblast proliferation. An ATF/CRE site located in the proximal region of cyclin D1 promoter was reported to bind to CREB and AP1 proteins and mediate active transcription of the gene [Sabbah et al , 1999; Nagata et al , 2001; Datta et al , 2007]. It is also probable that ATF4 activates the cyclin D1 promoter through interactions with CREB and AP1 proteins. Future study will differentiate these possibilities. Future study will differentiate these possibilities. This family includes cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), cAMP-response element modulator (CREM), ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, and ATF4 [Ziff, 1990; Brindle and Montminy, 1992; Meyer and Habener, 1993; Sassone-Corsi, 1994; Hai et al , 1999]. Calvaria, which does not involve endochondral bone formation, has a relatively simple structure relative to other bones such as long bones and vertebrae.

Calvaria, which does not involve endochondral bone formation, has a relatively simple structure relative to other bones such as long bones and vertebrae. The embryonic lens in double homozygous p53/Atf4−/− mice does not undergo apoptosis [Tanaka et al , 1998; Hettmann et al , 2000]. The caspase family, a set of cysteine proteases that cleave a variety of substrates, plays a crucial role in apoptosis. The caspase family, a set of cysteine proteases that cleave a variety of substrates, plays a crucial role in apoptosis. The caspase family, a set of cysteine proteases that cleave a variety of substrates, plays a crucial role in apoptosis. Caspases are divided into two groups: “initiator” caspases such as caspase-8 and -9 and “executioner” caspases including caspase-3, -6, and -7 [Shi, 2002].

ReagentsTissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan, UT). ATF4 functions as both transcriptional repressor and activator by forming homodimers and heterodimers with members of the AP-1 and C/EBP family of protein, or interacting with many other partners, such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promoter element 1-binding protein, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, NF-E2-related factor 2, c-maf, p300, Zhangfei, factor inhibiting ATF4-mediated transcription, special AT-rich sequence binding protein 2, transcription factor IIAγ, and runt-related transcription factor 2 [Hai and Curran, 1991; Chevray and Nathans, 1992; Nishizawa and Nagata, 1992; Vallejo et al , 1993; Vinson et al , 1993; Motohashi et al , 1997; Reddy et al , 1997; He et al , 2001; Lassot et al , 2005; Xiao et al , 2005; Yu et al , 2005, 2008b; Dobreva et al , 2006; Hogan et al , 2006]. Other reagents were obtained from the following sources: Antibodies against cyclins D1, D3, p21, p27, CDK2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or goat IgG from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody against (β-actin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), BrdU immunostaining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) from Invitrogen, ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Calvariae were then bisected perpendicular to the sagittal suture through the central portion of the parietal bones, parallel to lamboidal and coronal sutures, and embedded in paraffin to obtain sections of a standard area according to the method described by Zhao et al  [2000].

Cell Cultures and Isolation of Primary BMSCsMouse MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) preosteoblasts were described previously [Xiao et al , 1997; Wang et al , 1999] and maintained in ascorbic acid-free alpha-modified Eagle's medium (alpha-MEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (proliferation medium). Isolation of mouse primary BMSCs was described previously [Xiao et al , 2002]. ATF4 expression is up-regulated by several factors/ stressors, including oxygen deprivation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress [Ameri et al , 2004; Blais et al , 2004; Roybal et al , 2005]. MTS AssayMTS assay was described previously [Singha et al , 2007]. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h to allow attachment. [3H] Thymidine IncorporationCells were plated in 12-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in proliferation medium for 24 h and switched to 0.1% FBS alpha-MEM for another 24 h and [3H] thymidine was then added to a final concentration of 5 μCi/ml and incubated at 37°C for 1 h in proliferation medium. Cells were harvested, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

BrdU staining was performed using cells cultured in 8-well culture chambers (Nalgene Nunc, NY) or 10-μm sections of calvariae from wt and Atf4−/− mice. After sacrifice, 10-μm sections of calvariae were obtained as described previously [Demiralp et al , 2002]. To identify actively proliferating cells, nuclei that have incorporated BrdU were detected using a Zymed BrdU immunostaining kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. To identify actively proliferating cells, nuclei that have incorporated BrdU were detected using a Zymed BrdU immunostaining kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were counterstained with Hematoxylin. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)Tibias (6/group) were isolated and soft tissues were removed. The levels of mRNA were calculated by the ΔCT (the difference between the threshold cycles) method [Wang et al , 2004]. The mRNA level of each gene was normalized to Gapdh mRNA. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/ Tween-20 (TBST) buffer, probed with antibodies (1:1,000) against cyclins D1, D3, CDK2, p21, and p27 followed by incubation with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Finally, blots were striped 2 times in buffer containing 65 mM Tris–Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.7% (v/v) (β-mercaptoethanol at 65°C for 15 min and re-probed with (β-actin antibody (1:2,000) for normalization. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)MC-4 cells, which contain high levels of Atf4 mRNA, were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2.
