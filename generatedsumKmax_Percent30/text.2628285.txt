Sample sizes for each experiment were determined by power analysis on pilot data. Error bars reflect the between groups standard error of the mean. Prior work has demonstrated that this measure is highly sensitive to spinal cord learning and metaplastic inhibition (Grau et al , 1998 and 2006). Because some readers may wish to examine the relationship between flexion duration and performance, the response number data have been made available in the online supplement.

All subjects were tested 24 h later, a time point which is associated with a robust spinal learning deficit under these stimulus conditions (Crown et al , 2002b).Impact of a mGluR1 antagonistTo test whether mGluR1 is necessary for inhibiting spinal learning we used the noncompetitive antagonist 7-(hydroxy-imino)cycloproa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) at doses that are known to affect spinal nociceptive plasticity (Neugebauer et al , 1999). Animals that were given saline and uncontrollable shock had impaired learning, demonstrating shock-induced metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning (Figure 1F).

No other main effects or interactions were significant, all Fs < 1.32, p > .05. No other main effects or interactions were significant, all Fs < 1.32, p > .05. With this simple preparation, it can be shown that stimulation alters the capacity for spinal learning in a bi-directional fashion that is reminiscent of hippocampal metaplasticity (Grau et al , 2006).

With this simple preparation, it can be shown that stimulation alters the capacity for spinal learning in a bi-directional fashion that is reminiscent of hippocampal metaplasticity (Grau et al , 2006). If mGluRs underlie metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning, DHPG should induce a lasting effect that mirrors the established time course of shock-induced inhibition (Crown et al , 2002b). The mean shock intensity ranged from 0.53 (± 0.04) to 0.73 (± 0.08) mA and the mean duration of the initial response (± SE) ranged from 0.14 (± 0.01) to 0.17 (± 0.01) s. Independent ANOVAs failed to reveal any significant main effects or interactions on either outcome, all Fs < 2.76, p > .05.The impact of drug treatment on spinal learning is illustrated in Figure 3. DHPG delivered 24h prior to testing impaired spinal instrumental learning (Figure 3A, B). We first used the staurosporine-derivative bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), GF 109203X at a range of doses that have been shown to inhibit PKC (Herbert et al , 1990; Toullec et al , 1991) and affect pain behavior when administered intrathecally (Yashpal et al , 1995; Heinke and Sandkuhler, 2005; Hua et al , 1999). ANOVA on the BIM data confirmed that the linear component of the Drug X Shock interaction was significant, F(1, 48) = 5.28, p < .05. There was also a significant Drug X Shock interaction, F(1, 28) = 17.20, p < .001. This suggests that PKC is involved in metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning but has little effect on the rate of spinal learning itself. This suggests that PKC is involved in metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning but has little effect on the rate of spinal learning itself.

This suggests that PKC is involved in metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning but has little effect on the rate of spinal learning itself. Prior studies suggest that DHPG activates PKC in a BIM-reversible manner (Camodeca et al , 1999; Fundytus et al , 2001; Giles et al , 2007). Prior studies suggest that DHPG activates PKC in a BIM-reversible manner (Camodeca et al , 1999; Fundytus et al , 2001; Giles et al , 2007). Prior studies suggest that DHPG activates PKC in a BIM-reversible manner (Camodeca et al , 1999; Fundytus et al , 2001; Giles et al , 2007). Manipulation of other spinal receptors, including iGluRs, serotonergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic, and opioid systems, has only transient effects (for review see (Grau et al , 2006). Spinal learning performance correlates with the mRNA levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) facilitates spinal learning (Baumbauer et al , 2007a; Gomez-Pinilla et al , 2007). These molecules are linked to NMDAR-mediated long-term potentiation (Yin and Tully, 1996; Poncer et al , 2002; Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005), suggesting a mechanism for spinal learning with response-contingent shock.NMDARs detect coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity and allow calcium influx eventually leading to altered synaptic strength.

If, as suggested above, NMDAR conductances are altered by increased PKC phosphorylation following DHPG or uncontrollable shock, the threshold for synaptic modification may shift downward (Figure 8B). Links to Spinal NociceptionSpinal mGluRs are involved in nociceptive processing (Coderre and Melzack, 1992; Fisher and Coderre, 1996a; Fisher and Coderre, 1996b; Stanfa and Dickenson, 1998; Neugebauer et al , 1999; Bordi and Ugolini, 2000; Karim et al , 2001; Fisher et al , 2002; Fundytus et al , 2002; Mills et al , 2002; Zhang et al , 2002).

This supports other work linking metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning with nociceptive plasticity. Inhibition of spinal learning can be induced by incision injury or intradermal carrageenan and uncontrollable shock produces a tactile hyper-reactivity (Ferguson et al , 2006; Young et al , 2007). Removing descending inhibition with a dorsolateral funiculus transection increases nociceptive reactivity (Eide and Hole, 1993; Liu et al , 1997) and renders spinal learning vulnerable to metaplastic inhibition (Crown and Grau, 2005). Alterations in spinal metaplasticity could have profound effects on recovery of function by altering the spinal cord’s ability regain proper function (Edgerton et al , 2001; Hook and Grau, 2007; Courtine et al , 2008).

Recent data indicate that glutamate-mediated cell death may involve plasticity and trafficking of iGluRs (Hermann et al , 2001; Beattie et al , 2002; Ogoshi et al , 2005; Stellwagen et al , 2005). Surgery and intrathecal cannulizationSurgery and intrathecal cannulization were performed using procedures described in detail elsewhere (Grau et al , 1998; Ferguson et al , 2003; Ferguson et al , 2006). The exposed end of tubing was secured to the adjacent tissue using cyanoacrylate. injection of 2.5 ml of warm 0.9 % saline and placed in temperature-controlled environment (approximately 25.5 °C). To prevent injury to the hind limbs during recovery, the rear legs of spinalized animals were maintained in a normal flexed position by two pieces of porous tape (Orthaletic, 1.3 cm [width]) gently wrapped once around the rat's body. This procedure has been found to generate reliable metaplastic inhibition of spinal learning that lasts at least 48 h (Crown et al , 2002b). Briefly, rats were loosely restrained in Plexiglas tubes (20.0 cm [length] x 7.0 cm [internal diameter]). Briefly, rats were loosely restrained in Plexiglas tubes (20.0 cm [length] x 7.0 cm [internal diameter]). Two slots (6.0 cm [length] x 1.7cm [width]) were cut in the sides and base of the tube, allowing both hind legs to hang freely. Two slots (6.0 cm [length] x 1.7cm [width]) were cut in the sides and base of the tube, allowing both hind legs to hang freely. A fine wire (0.01 sq mm [36 AWG]) was attached to the end of the rod, extending from the rear of the foot to a digital input monitored by a Macintosh computer. A ground wire was connected to a 1 mm stainless steel rod that was placed in the solution. The state of this circuit was sampled at 30 Hz.Flexion force was measured prior to instrumental testing using a strain gauge connected to the foot by a monofilament plastic line ("4 lb test" Stren, Dupont). Shock intensity was adjusted to produce a flexion force of a fixed value. Shock intensity was adjusted to produce a flexion force of a fixed value. This plasticity of plasticity or ‘metaplasticity’ (Abraham and Bear, 1996; Abraham and Tate, 1997) is associated with trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors (Hellier et al , 2007). The computer recorded the amount of time that the contact electrode was in contact with the solution (Time in solution). Flexion number was evaluated as a measure of motor performance and is displayed in the online supplement. iGluR function can be affected by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and activation of downstream protein kinase C (PKC). For the group I mGluR experiments drugs were purchased from Tocris (Ellisvile, MO) and subjects were given 1 of 4 doses of drug dissolved in 3 μl of vehicle. Previous work has isolated spinal learning to these segments (Liu et al , 2005). Previous work has isolated spinal learning to these segments (Liu et al , 2005). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 g, 4ºC for 30 min. Given the sensitivity of the assay and the small amount of total tissue collected, our initial analyses examined activity in the total protein fraction. Given the sensitivity of the assay and the small amount of total tissue collected, our initial analyses examined activity in the total protein fraction. A proprietary PKC substrate (Stressgen Bioreagents) was pre-coated on the wells of the microtiter plate. Next, the microtiter plate was incubated with a phospho-specific IgG antibody to label all the phosphorylated sites resulting from active PKC in the samples. Fresh lysis buffer (without cord lysate) was included in the assay as a blank, and cord lysate without ATP served as the negative control.
