Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants from the two families. Family AP188 (figure 1A) was recruited from a remote village in Sindh province, Pakistan, and had four individuals (VI-1, VI-2, VI-4, VI-5) presenting with tightly curled scalp hairs (figure 1C–E). Family AP216 was recruited from the Upper Dir district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, and has three individuals (II-1, II-2, II-4) with WH (figure 1B). All individuals from both families showed normal craniofacial features, teeth, nails and sweating, and no evidence of palmoplantar keratoderma, heart disease, chronic diarrhoea, immune deficiencies or intellectual disability. DNA samples from selected family members (figure 1A, B) underwent a genome scan using the Infinium HumanCoreExome BeadChip (Illumina, USA), which includes ~550 000 markers. Of 176 homozygous variants, only two variants had MAF <0.01 in South Asian alleles in ExAC: a synonymous FAM134C NM_178126.3:c.906T>C variant that is heterozygous in 89 out of 16 512 South Asian ExAC alleles (MAF=0.005) and in two ExAC alleles of other ethnicity; and a missense variant c.950T>C (p.(Leu317Pro)) within KRT25 (NM_18154.3) that is heterozygous in three ExAC South Asian alleles (MAF=0.0002), but was not identified in 104 876 ExAC alleles of other ethnicity. Sanger sequencing of the KRT25 missense variant using DNA samples from the remaining members of AP188 and AP216 confirmed segregation with the ARWH phenotype in both families (figure 1A, B, see online supplementary figure S1A). The observation of sparse WH in affected individuals who are homozygous for the KRT25 c.950T>C variant recapitulates the phenotype in mutant mice. The KRT25 transcript and the encoded protein are expressed in all three layers of the follicle IRS and the hair shaft medulla.3 Likewise, other type I keratins namely KRT27 and KRT28 have the same expression pattern, while of the type II keratins, only KRT71 is expressed in all three IRS layers.3 The WH phenotype observed in individuals homozygous for the KRT25 c.950T>C variant implies that heterodimerisation between K25 and K71 is essential for stable hair structure, and is not compensated by interaction of K71 with K27 or K28. This is further supported by the abnormal localisation of K71 and irregularity of Henle’s and Huxley’s layers of the IRS in Krt25-mutant Re/+ mice.16 Additionally, KRT71 mutations independently cause hypotrichosis and WH in humans.7 Hair keratins are known to heterodimerise such that a type I keratin is required to partner with a type II keratin to form KIFs that are basic building blocks for hair structure.17 Interestingly, disulfide bonding between cysteine residues of partnering keratins has been shown as an important mechanism for the assembly of keratins into KIFs.18 Human K25 has cysteine residues at positions 325 and 335 that are highly conserved in mammalian K25 sequences (see online supplementary figure S1B). Hair keratins are known to heterodimerise such that a type I keratin is required to partner with a type II keratin to form KIFs that are basic building blocks for hair structure.17 Interestingly, disulfide bonding between cysteine residues of partnering keratins has been shown as an important mechanism for the assembly of keratins into KIFs.18 Human K25 has cysteine residues at positions 325 and 335 that are highly conserved in mammalian K25 sequences (see online supplementary figure S1B). Because K25 is also localised to the medulla, structural defects from improper heterodimerisation with other type II keratins are also expected to affect the hair shaft. The variant is predicted to disrupt the α-helical rod 2B domain of K25 and to interfere with heterodimerisation with type II keratins, which are expected to lead to irregular and fragile hair that is characteristic of the WH phenotype. To date, mutations in lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6/P2RY5, MIM 609239) and lipase H (LIPH, MIM 607365) are known to underlie ARWH with or without hypotrichosis.5–7 On the other hand, ADWH and hypotrichosis (MIM 613981) are caused by mutations in two type II IRS-specific genes KRT71 (MIM 608245) and KRT74 (MIM 608248).810 Additionally, a KRT74 variant has been identified to cause pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia.11 All four genes are abundantly expressed in the hair follicle. The identification of a KRT25 mutation as a cause of WH in humans can help direct efforts in the development of therapies for hair keratin disorders.1
