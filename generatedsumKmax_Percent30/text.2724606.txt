Finally, A431-VDR cells transfected with p63 siRNA also did not show increased cell invasion (compare lanes 2 and 6) confirming that overexpression of VDR can also rescue the effects of silencing ΔNp63α. The role of p63 in epithelial tissue development, in particular in stratified epithelial morphogenesis is well established (Candi et al , 2007). The role of p63 in epithelial tissue development, in particular in stratified epithelial morphogenesis is well established (Candi et al , 2007). The predominant isoforms of p63 observed during development are TAp63α and ΔNp63α; however, the functional relevance of the other p63 isoforms still needs to be addressed (Koster et al , 2004). The predominant isoforms of p63 observed during development are TAp63α and ΔNp63α; however, the functional relevance of the other p63 isoforms still needs to be addressed (Koster et al , 2004). The loss of p63 expression is correlated with cancer progression in various cancers, including prostate and bladder cancers (Park et al , 2004; Parsons et al , 2001; Urist et al , 2002).

The loss of p63 expression is correlated with cancer progression in various cancers, including prostate and bladder cancers (Park et al , 2004; Parsons et al , 2001; Urist et al , 2002). ΔNp63α is the most predominant isoform of p63 expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelia and is overexpressed in several cancers. ΔNp63α antagonizes the functions of p53 and TAp63 by forming heterotetramers or by competitive binding to specific DNA sequences (Yang et al , 1998). ΔNp63α antagonizes the functions of p53 and TAp63 by forming heterotetramers or by competitive binding to specific DNA sequences (Yang et al , 1998).

The active form of vitamin D has also been shown to inhibit the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells through VDR (Tokar and Webber, 2005). Interestingly, direct transcriptional activation of E-cadherin by vitamin D has also been shown to promote growth arrest in colon cancer cells (Palmer et al , 2001). Finally, VDR is repressed by SNAIL and a negative correlation between SNAIL and VDR is reported in a colon cancer cell line (Palmer et al , 2004; Pena et al , 2005). However, additional studies are required to understand the precise role of VDR in p63-mediated functions, in particular in epithelial morphogenesis. However, additional studies are required to understand the precise role of VDR in p63-mediated functions, in particular in epithelial morphogenesis. The modified pLentiV6 vector contains additional restriction sites and the pLentiV6-eGFP were obtained from Thomas Brown and Steven Berberich, respectively, both at Wright State University, Dayton, OH. TaqMan based real-time PCR analysis was performed on ABI Prism7900HT sequence detection system using TaqMan 2× master mix and gene-specific assays on demand. Total protein amounts were measured using BCA protein detection method and equivalent amounts of protein extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and processed for immunoblotting analysis. Mouse monoclonal anti-p63 C-12 antibody was used for detecting exogenous ΔNp63α protein. High expression of VDR is associated with favorable prognosis in colon cancers and loss of VDR expression is associated with an increase in metastatic proteins such as SNAIL (Palmer et al , 2004; Pena et al , 2005).

Fragmented chromatin was pre-cleared using protein G beads and subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-p63 4A4, rabbit polyclonal anti-p63 H-129 and normal mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCR conditions used were as follows, a total of 40 cycles were performed, each consisting of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 60°C and 45 seconds at 68°C.

For transactivation assays, cells were plated on 12-well plates and transfected with 1000 ng VDR-Luc reporter and Renilla luciferase constructs along with desired plasmids. For transactivation assays, cells were plated on 12-well plates and transfected with 1000 ng VDR-Luc reporter and Renilla luciferase constructs along with desired plasmids. At 6 hours post-transfection, fresh medium was added, and after 24 hours, another round of transfection was performed as described above. At 6 hours post-transfection, fresh medium was added, and after 24 hours, another round of transfection was performed as described above. Slides were mounted using Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs) viewed with a Nikon FXA fluorescence microscope. p63 contains three functional domains, an N-terminal transactivation (TA), a central DNA-binding domain and an oligomerization domain. As expected, we also observed a significant increase in p21 transcript levels with TAp63γ, TAp63β and TAp63α, and ΔNp63β isoforms but not ΔNp63γ and ΔNp63α. ΔNp63α does not inhibit TAp63-mediated induction of VDRSeveral studies have reported that the ΔNp63α isoform exerts a dominant-negative effect towards p53 and TAp63 isoforms. Both p21 and IGFBP-3 were shown to be repressed by ΔNp63α and therefore were used as controls for the ΔNp63α-mediated dominant-negative effect on TAp63 (Barbieri et al , 2005; Westfall et al , 2003). Both p21 and IGFBP-3 were shown to be repressed by ΔNp63α and therefore were used as controls for the ΔNp63α-mediated dominant-negative effect on TAp63 (Barbieri et al , 2005; Westfall et al , 2003). Both p21 and IGFBP-3 were shown to be repressed by ΔNp63α and therefore were used as controls for the ΔNp63α-mediated dominant-negative effect on TAp63 (Barbieri et al , 2005; Westfall et al , 2003).

The TP63 gene generates six different isoforms: three TA isoforms (TAp63γ, TAp63β and TAp63α) and three ΔN isoforms (ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β and ΔNp63α) because of the differential promoter usage and alternative splicing. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ΔNp63α does not act in a dominant-negative manner towards TAp63-mediated induction of VDR. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ΔNp63α does not act in a dominant-negative manner towards TAp63-mediated induction of VDR. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ΔNp63α does not act in a dominant-negative manner towards TAp63-mediated induction of VDR. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ΔNp63α does not act in a dominant-negative manner towards TAp63-mediated induction of VDR. First, we tested whether ΔNp63α can transactivate a luciferase reporter under the control of the full-length VDR promoter (VDR-Luc). First, we tested whether ΔNp63α can transactivate a luciferase reporter under the control of the full-length VDR promoter (VDR-Luc). Co-transfection of VDR-Luc, along with increasing concentrations of ΔNp63α, led to a dose-dependent increase in VDR-Luc activity (Fig. 3B) (Romano et al , 2006). The β-actin promoter was used as a negative control (Fig. p63, in particular ΔNp63α, is highly expressed in basal layers of stratified epithelium and is essential for maintenance of epithelial tissue integrity. A431-VDR cells also showed increased VDR expression compared with A431-eGFP cells. p63-knockout mice exhibit severe developmental defects, including defects in limbs, hair follicles, teeth and epidermal development (Mills et al , 1999; Yang et al , 1999). 6B, compare lanes 3 and 4), which could be attributed to silencing of the endogenous p63.
