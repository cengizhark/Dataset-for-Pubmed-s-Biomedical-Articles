The production of red macroalgae steadily increased annually, achieving the annual production of ~1.8 × 1010 kg in 20159. S. cerevisiae is robust even in the presence of various stresses in industrial cultivation environments27, 28. S. cerevisiae is robust even in the presence of various stresses in industrial cultivation environments27, 28. In addition, red macroalgae have the higher carbohydrate contents and simpler carbohydrate compositions than other marine algae1,2. At 0, 10, and 20 g/L AB, the cell concentrations obtained from strain D452-L124 were 1.85, 1.43, and 1.08 g/L at 24 h, respectively (Fig. Therefore, red macroalgae are regarded as feasible feedstocks for producing fuels and chemicals. H3PO4 of the agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 using Ca(OH)2 (Fig. H3PO4 of the agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 using Ca(OH)2 (Fig. H3PO4 of the agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 using Ca(OH)2 (Fig. Therefore, the initial cell concentration of strain D452-L124 was increased from 2 g/L (Fig. However, the AHGol yields decreased to 0.42 and 0.20 g/g, respectively, when AB was increased to 45 and 90 g/L (Table 1). First, it could be due to the transglycosylation activity of β-galactosidase encoded by LAC4 introduced into S. cerevisiae. Transglycosylation activity in the GH family generally occurs at a high mass ratio of substrate to enzyme34, 35.

The engineered strain with CS8-LAC12 and CS6-LAC4 integration was named D452-L124.To construct plasmid pET21α-GRE3, the GRE3 gene (NCBI GenBank: 856504) encoding AR was amplified using PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA with primer pairs GRE3-F and GRE3-R (Table S1). It is impossible to valorize AHG as the main sugar of red macroalgae for fuel and chemical production without resolving the instability problem of AHG.

After acid hydrolysis, agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 while H3PO4 from agarose hydrolysate was removed using Ca(OH)2. In addition, sorbitan can be converted to isosorbide, 1,4:3,6-dianhydrohexitol, by dehydration. The initial cell densities were adjusted to approximately OD600 = 13. Strain D452-L124 was grown in 5 mL of the first seed medium before transferring into a 1 L flask containing 250 mL of the second seed medium.

GC/MS analysisTo investigate the conversion of AHG and AB to AHGol and ABol, respectively, by in vitro AR enzyme reactions and by fermentation and the chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbide, GC/MS analysis were performed.

The samples were trimethylsilylated by adding 45 μL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. However, since AHG is already the dehydrated form of galactose, AHGol, the anhydrohexitol form of AHG, can be produced just by reducing the aldehyde group of AHG without dehydration, resulting in an energy-efficient process.

All experiments were performed and recorded on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer operating at 900 MHz and at 298 K (Bruker, Billerica, MA). A total of 2048 and 128 complex points were recorded in the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively. Third-generation biomass, represented by marine algae, has emerged as the valorization resource for producing bio-based fuels and chemicals1–3. To date, sugar alcohols and anhydrohexitols have been mainly produced by chemical reduction12,16. This is because of many advantages of third-generation biomass over lignocellulose from plants. In vitro enzymatic conversion of AHG to AHGol and AB to agarobitolTo valorize AHG, it is necessary to resolve the heat- and acid-labile problems of AHG10 and to convert the rare sugar, AHG, to a platform chemical.
