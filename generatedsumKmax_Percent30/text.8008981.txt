Combined with numerous other studies finding it to be an independent predictor of mortality,9,13,15,16,19,21,28-31 age represents a robust prognosticator that clinicians can easily use at the bedside. Although various consensus documents and expert panels highlight advanced age as a relative contraindication to ECMO,5,34,35 our study provides granularity to this recommendation and can help to inform future guidelines. Further refinements in patient selection will require assessment in clinical trials in specific populations, as is currently being done in the EUROSHOCK (Testing the Value of Novel Strategy and Its Cost Efficacy in Order to Improve the Poor Outcomes in Cardiogenic Shock, NCT04184635) and ANCHOR (Assessment of ECMO in Acute Myocardial Infarction Cardiogenic Shock, NCT03813134) trials, where ECMO is being compared with the standard of care in the acute myocardial infarction population. Indication for ECMO was identified and grouped into the following 6 categories.HTx/primary graft dysfunction includes patients who had a history of HTx with acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection, or primary graft dysfunction.Postcardiotomy identifies patients with persistent circulatory failure postcardiotomy.Myocardial infarction includes patients with shock in the setting of acute coronary syndrome.Cardiomyopathy includes patients with acute heart failure due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, acute myocarditis, chronic HTx rejection, or patients with cardiac arrest.Other cardiogenic shock encompassed patients not included in the above causes of cardiogenic shock, including those with ventricular arrhythmias.Noncardiogenic shock primarily encompassed patients with mixed shock (both vasodilatory and obstructive), sepsis, and respiratory failure. Mechanical circuit complications during ECMO support were documented. Mechanical circuit complications during ECMO support were documented. Of note, 97 patients (13.3%) in this cohort received ECMO in the setting of cardiac arrest, but these patients were categorized according to their underlying disease process (cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, etc). At the time of ECMO initiation, 76.5% of patients were already mechanically ventilated. At the time of ECMO initiation, 76.5% of patients were already mechanically ventilated. Patients were primarily cannulated in the operating room (49.9%) or intensive care unit (23.8%), with a minority cannulated in the catheterization laboratory (5.0%) or emergency department (0.3%). Some patients (7.7%) were also transferred from other institutions already on ECMO support.Forty percent of the study population (n = 290) survived to discharge. Some patients (7.7%) were also transferred from other institutions already on ECMO support.Forty percent of the study population (n = 290) survived to discharge. Patients had a median intensive care unit length of stay of 13 days (IQR 5–26 days) and hospital length of stay of 19 days (IQR 5–39 days) (Supplementary Fig. Patients had a median intensive care unit length of stay of 13 days (IQR 5–26 days) and hospital length of stay of 19 days (IQR 5–39 days) (Supplementary Fig. Of the patients who died on ECMO support, the median time on ECMO support was 4 days (IQR 2–8 days) (Supplementary Fig. For patients who survived to decannulation but died during hospitalization, median time of ECMO support was 5 days (IQR 3–9 days) and median time of hospitalization was 23 days (IQR 14–39 days) (Supplementary Fig. Of the 109 patients with these complications, 82 (75.2%) died.All vascular complications occurred during ECMO support. Of the 109 patients with these complications, 82 (75.2%) died.All vascular complications occurred during ECMO support. Of the 109 patients with these complications, 82 (75.2%) died.All vascular complications occurred during ECMO support. Circuit complications on ECMO were overall very rare, with oxygenator failure requiring exchange and thrombosis requiring circuit change occurring in 8 patients (1.1%) each.Patients on ECMO were prone to infection, which occurred in 241 patients (33.3%) (Table 3). Use of mechanical ventilation (aOR 0.53, IQR 0.361–0.890, P = .016) was associated with a decreased odds of mortality (aOR 0.53, IQR 0.31–0.89, P = .016). Among those patients who survived to decannulation, a higher body mass index (BMI) (aOR 1.17, IQR 1.01–1.35, P = .036) and major bleeding while on ECMO support (aOR 1.92, IQR 1.23–2.99, P = .004) were associated with an increased risk of death. The main indications for deployment of VA-ECMO were postcardiotomy shock (31%), cardiomyopathy (including acute heart failure decompensation) (26%), and myocardial infarction (17%). Risk factors for mortality included older age, higher BMI, female sex, and major bleeding while on ECMO support. Risk factors for mortality included older age, higher BMI, female sex, and major bleeding while on ECMO support. ComplicationsDespite receiving care at high-volume centers with expertise in management of ECMO, our cohort had a high incidence of complications occurring during ECMO support or the remainder of the hospitalization, including acute renal dysfunction (45%), major bleeding (41%), and infection (33%). OutcomesIn our cohort, 60% of patients (n = 433) died during hospitalization, consistent with prior reports.9,14,17,24 Data from a large, international registry of more than 300 ECMO centers, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, demonstrated a 41% survival to discharge for patients who had ECMO initiated for cardiac etiologies.4 This survival rate is similar to that found in an analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, where 43.3% of patients treated with ECMO between 2007 and 2014 survived to discharge.25 In that study, 3.5% of patients were bridged to LVAD, similar to a recent analysis of the Society for Thoracic Surgeons database, which demonstrates that, of 19,825 patients receiving durable MCS between January 2008 and December 2017, only 933 patients (4.7%) were bridged via ECMO.26 Compared with other critically ill patients (Interagency for Mechanical Circulatory Support profile 1), patients requiring ECMO had an inferior 12-month survival, although a high hazard for death occurred in the first 6 months after MCS implantation. Duke Clinical Research Institute served as the data coordinating and statistical analysis center. Other baseline factors that seem to predict ECMO outcomes include history of diabetes mellitus29,33 and elevated bilirubin and lactate at time of ECMO initiation.9,20,21,29Various models incorporating baseline characteristics have been developed to risk stratify patients before ECMO initiation. A possible explanation is that mechanical ventilation may be representative of a more controlled setting for ECMO initiation (in the cardiac intensive care unit for a patient with slowly worsening shock) as opposed to more emergent initiation (out-of-hospital cardiac arrest), which may occur before or during intubation. Three of our predictive factors (age, female sex, BMI) are also a part of another score, the ENCOURAGE score, validated to predict outcomes after acute myocardial infarction VA-ECMO use.31
