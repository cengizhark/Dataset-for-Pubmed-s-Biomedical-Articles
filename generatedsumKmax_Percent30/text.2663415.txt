In our previous studies we demonstrated that mutant Httexp protein specifically binds to and activates type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R1) (Tang et al , 2003). The average slice thickness after histological processing was determined to be 22 µm. Statistical data analysisFor comparison between two groups, ANOVA with post hoc testing was used to statistically analyze data. Mutant ataxin-3 specifically binds to InsP3R1 in vitroTo determine if ATX3exp behaves similar to Httexp and also binds to the InsP3R1 carboxy-terminal region, we expressed EGFP-ATX3-19Q, EGFP-ATX3-77Q and EGFP-ATX3-127Q proteins (Wang et al , 2000) in HEK293 cells and performed a series of GST pull-down experiments with bacterially-expressed InsP3R1 carboxy-terminal fragment GST-IC10 (aa F2627 - A2749 of rat InsP3R1). The precipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies. Similar to Htt (Tang et al , 2003), association of ataxin-3 with IC10 fragment was dependent on polyQ expansion as wild type EGFP-ATX3-19Q protein did not bind to GST-IC10 (Fig 1A). Similar to Htt (Tang et al , 2003), association of ataxin-3 with IC10 fragment was dependent on polyQ expansion as wild type EGFP-ATX3-19Q protein did not bind to GST-IC10 (Fig 1A). Similar to Htt (Tang et al , 2003), association of ataxin-3 with IC10 fragment was dependent on polyQ expansion as wild type EGFP-ATX3-19Q protein did not bind to GST-IC10 (Fig 1A). In the next series of experiments we tested the association of full-length InsP3R1 with ataxin-3. In the next series of experiments we tested the association of full-length InsP3R1 with ataxin-3. The EGFP-ATX3-19Q, EGFP-ATX3-77Q and EGFP-ATX3-127Q proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells as described above and solubilized in 1% CHAPS. We found that full-length InsP3R1 associated with EGFP-ATX3-77Q and EGFP-ATX3-127Q mutant proteins, but not with the wild type EGFP-ATX3-19Q protein (Fig 1B). Thus, association of full-length InsP3R1 with ataxin-3 also depends on polyQ-expansion in ataxin-3 sequence.In addition to InsP3R channels, Ca2+ release from neuronal endoplasmic reticulum can also be mediated by ryanodine receptor (RyanR) channels. It is generally assumed that many polyQ-expansion disorders share a common pathogenic mechanism (Cummings and Zoghbi, 2000; Gusella and MacDonald, 2000; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). It is generally assumed that many polyQ-expansion disorders share a common pathogenic mechanism (Cummings and Zoghbi, 2000; Gusella and MacDonald, 2000; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). It is generally assumed that many polyQ-expansion disorders share a common pathogenic mechanism (Cummings and Zoghbi, 2000; Gusella and MacDonald, 2000; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). Western blotting with anti-RyanR monclonal antibodies did not detect RyanR1 in precipitated samples (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that RyanR1 does not bind to ATX3-127Q and that association with ATX3exp is specific for InsP3R1. Microsomes prepared from Sf9 cells co-infected with RT1:ATX3-19Q or RT1:ATX3-77Q baculoviruses were fused to planar lipid bilayers as described above. Addition of 100 nM InsP3 induced only low levels of channel activity in InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-19Q (Fig 2G, second trace, Fig 2H), but resulted in dramatic activation of InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-77Q (Fig 2I, second trace, Fig 2K). Elevation of InsP3 concentration to 2 µM increased activity of InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-19Q (Fig 2G, third trace, Fig 2H), but had no additional effect on activity of InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-77Q (Fig 2I, third trace, Fig 2K). In a series of biochemical and functional experiments we investigated interactions between ataxin-3 and InsP3R1. Even stronger response to DHPG was observed in MSNs transfected with ATX3-127Q plasmid (Fig 3A, fourth row, Figs 3H and 3I). We discovered that application of 300 nM bradykinin (BK), an agonist of InsP3-coupled receptor, induced much larger Ca2+ responses in hF-SCA3 cells than in control hF cells (Figs 4B, 4C). Obtained results suggested that deranged neuronal Ca2+ signaling plays a significant role in SCA3 pathology; calcium signaling stabilizers may be considered as potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of SCA3 patients. The expression of ataxin-3 in these cortical lysates was analyzed by anti-Atx3 monoclonal antibodies. Only wild type mouse Atx3 was detected in cortical lysates from wild type mouse brains (Fig 6A).

Thus, dantrolene can be considered a general Ca2+ signaling stabilizer. The beam-walking data were collected at 2, 4, 7.5, 10, 12 and 13.5 (washout) months of age. The beam-walking data were collected at 2, 4, 7.5, 10, 12 and 13.5 (washout) months of age. For our studies SCA3-YAC-84Q mouse was recreated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) using C57BL/6 mouse strain egg and SCA3-YAC-84Q mouse frozen sperm. In contrast, none of the mice in WT groups exhibited crawling behavior or fell off the beams at any age tested.

We further found that front/hind footprint overlap was significantly higher in SCA3 control group than in WT control group (Fig. We further found that front/hind footprint overlap was significantly higher in SCA3 control group than in WT control group (Fig. Human primary fibroblast linesPrimary human fibroblasts (hF-SCA3) derived from a 38-year-old symptomatic SCA3 patient (subject GM06151) and the hF from healthy individual (subject GM02185C) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research).

However, Xestospongin C is not stable in vivo and not appropriate for animal trials. Thus, instead of targeting InsP3R for our animal studies we decided to target another intracellular Ca2+ release channel – the ryanodine receptor (RyanR). RyanR are widely expressed in the nervous system (Giannini et al , 1995). RyanR are widely expressed in the nervous system (Giannini et al , 1995). Therefore, we reasoned that pharmacological inhibition of RyanR may compensate for enhanced activity of InsP3R1 and result in neuroprotective effects in SCA3 mouse model. Therefore, we reasoned that pharmacological inhibition of RyanR may compensate for enhanced activity of InsP3R1 and result in neuroprotective effects in SCA3 mouse model. This indicates that dantrolene is neuroprotective and supports the hypothesis that deranged calcium signaling may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SCA3. Our results indicate that calcium signaling stabilizers such as dantrolene should be considered as potential therapeutics for the treatment of SCA3 patients and possibily other neurodegenerative disorders.

Co-expression and functional reconstitution of ATX3-RT1 to BLMFull length ATX3-19Q and ATX3-77Q constructs were subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). At molecular level the cause of SCA3 is a polyQ expansion in the carboxy-terminal of ataxin-3 (ATX3, MJD1) protein (Kawaguchi et al , 1994; Paulson et al , 1997a). At molecular level the cause of SCA3 is a polyQ expansion in the carboxy-terminal of ataxin-3 (ATX3, MJD1) protein (Kawaguchi et al , 1994; Paulson et al , 1997a). The precipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Atx3 monoclonal antibodies 1H9. The microsomes from the RT1:ATX3-19Q and RT1:ATX3-77Q co-infected Sf9 cells were fused to bilayers and the bilayer current recordings and analysis were performed as described above. At 20 DIV the MSN cultures were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method with EGFP-C3 plasmid (Clontech) or a 1:3 mixture of EGFP:ATX3 expression plasmids as indicated in the text. 48 hr after transfection, the MSN neurons were loaded with 5 µM Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.3]) for 45 min at 37°C. For imaging experiments the coverslips were mounted onto a recording/perfusion chamber (RC-26G, Warner Instrument) maintained at 37°C (PH1, Warner Instrument), positioned on the movable stage of an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, and perfused with ACSF media by gravity flow. Images at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths were captured every 5 s and shown as 340/380 image ratios at time points as indicated. Ten months old SCA3-YAC-15Q mice and age-matched SCA3-YAC-84Q mice were terminally anesthetized by pentobarbital with the dosage of 60 mg/kg and perfused transcardially with 20 ml of 0.9% saline followed by 100 ml of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). After washed with PBS for 3×10 min, the sections were stained with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour at room temperature.

Signal was amplified with the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). The resulted beads were washed with extraction buffer A and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-InsP3R1 monoclonal antibody (UC Davis/NINDS/NIMH NeuroMab Facility, clone L24/18). The blood samples of 5 mice were harvested into a tube containing 50 µl ACD solution (2.2 g sodium citrate; 0.8 g citric acid, monohydrate; 2.24 g glucose, anhydrous dissolved in dH2O to the final volume 100ml).
