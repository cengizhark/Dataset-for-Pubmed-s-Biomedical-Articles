Given the current high relapse rate (Rafful et al , 2013; Zhu et al , 2012; Zhuang et al , 2015), and smoking-related morbidity and mortality (Danaei et al , 2009; Grunberg & Barry, 2015; Islami, Torre, & Jemal, 2015; Islami, Ward et al , 2015), this research is essential. LimitationsThere are several limitations to the results of this study. Second, the SIMS was added to an existing study designed to assess the effectiveness of prolonged NRT use, and not specifically to assess its validity and reliability.

Second, the SIMS was added to an existing study designed to assess the effectiveness of prolonged NRT use, and not specifically to assess its validity and reliability. It is the experience of disequilibrium that is proposed to be a key motivator for change, and it is the ability to tolerate disequilibrium that is proposed to be responsible for the maintenance of behaviour change, a process termed psychoadaptation. ParticipantsParticipants were 447 adult smokers (Mean age = 47 years, SD = 11.92; 51% Female; 44% White), smoking on average 17 cigarettes/day (SD = 8.36) pre quit, taking part in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of long-versus short-term nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using nicotine patches (Schnoll et al , 2015). InstrumentationThe subjective importance of smoking (SIMS).The SIMS is a 14-item measure developed to assess the psychological importance of cigarettes and cigarette smoking to a smoker. Results suggested that the SIMS is poorly suited for smokers smoking < 10 cigarettes/day.The SIMS was next administered to a sample of 202 Southeastern Pennsylvania adult daily cigarette smokers with no intention to quit (Mean age 31 years, SD = 8.07) taking part in a study to better understand their opinions on tobacco product advertising (Strasser et al , 2011). Although there was greater variability than the Quebec sample, the response probabilities for several items were highly skewed to ‘False’ (six-point False-True scale). The present study represents the third phase of testing, and includes 14 of the 17 original items, and revisions. We assessed nicotine dependence as it should be positively and strongly correlated with SIMS given cigarettes are nicotine delivery devices.Psychological correlates.The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (20 items) was used to assess positive and negative affect (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), Alpha = 0.823; the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (14 items) was used to assess anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure) (Snaith et al , 1995), Alpha = 0.933; The 21-item Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to assess Anxiety symptoms (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988), Alpha = 0.885. These variables were selected for their possible positive and negative relations to SIMS, and for assessment of construct validity.Demographic variables.We controlled for the demographic variables sex, race, education, marital status and income.Point prevalence abstinence.Our outcome variable was carbon monoxide (CO) verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 24 weeks (Schnoll et al , 2015). ESEM is a structural equation modelling (SEM) method that allows researchers to combine exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a single model (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009; Marsh et al , 2009). The process involves several steps. Factors associated with unsuccessful quitting include nicotine dependence, poor mental health, low social support for quitting, stress and lower self-efficacy beliefs about quitting (Cobb et al , 2014; Hiscock, Bauld, Amos, Fidler, & Munafo, 2012; Lukowski, Morris, Young, & Tinkelman, 2015; Raupach, Brown, Herbec, Brose, & West, 2014; Smit, Hoving, Schelleman-Offermans, West, & de Vries, 2014). We used SPSS 24 software for descriptive statistics and Mplus 7.0 software for the ESEM analysis.Given the ordinal nature of the SIMS variables, model parameter estimation employed a weighted least squares estimation technique (WLSMV) with robust standard errors, and a mean and variance adjusted chi-square (χ2) test statistic (Muthén, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997; Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2004). We evaluated our multivariate models for fit to the observed data using multiple indicators of model performance, including the χ2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), weighted root mean square residual (WRMR), standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (Jackson, Gillaspy, & Purc-Stephenson, 2009), along with substantive criteria (e.g., interpretability of factors). To account for missing data, Mplus estimates mean, variance and covariance parameters using a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimating procedure which employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, assuming data are missing at random (Muthén, 1998–2004a; 1998–2004b). Thus, cases with missing data on the covariates are not included in the analysis. Given only one eigenvalue > 1 (λ1=8.339) accounting for 60% of the variance, along with a scree plot (eigenvalue plot) elbow at 2 (also suggesting one factor), and 12 loadings ≥ 0.60, we selected the single factor solution as the best solution for these data. The model results with unstandardized path coefficients, standard errors, z-statistics, and p values are presented in (Table 5). We present significant effects only for sake of parsimony. Indeed, findings of such research suggest that becoming a non-smoker involves adopting a non-smoker identity (Lindgren et al , 2016; Tombor, Shahab, Brown, & West, 2013; Tombor et al , 2015; Vangeli & West, 2012). The purpose of the present study was to assess whether negative feelings about the self, associated with smoking, moderated the effect of the SIMS on PPA at 24 weeks post quit in a sample of participants involved in a NRT treatment study. We first assessed the factor structure of the measure we developed to better understand the SIMS, and then assessed whether disequilibrium moderated the relation between smoking’s subjective importance and abstinence 24-weeks post quit. When coupled with other findings supporting the possible role of self-conceptions and identity in the smoking cessation process (Berg et al , 2010; Gibbons & Gerrard, 1995; Lindgren et al , 2016; Pulvers et al , 2013; Shadel & Mermelstein, 1996; Tombor et al , 2013; Tombor et al , 2015; van den Putte et al , 2009; Vangeli & West, 2012), this finding supports recommendations for a more comprehensive program of research to identify the role of self-conceptions related to substance use behaviours (Lindgren et al , 2016). Self-concept formation involves identifying with activities that become important to the individual (Wigfield & Karpathian, 1991).
