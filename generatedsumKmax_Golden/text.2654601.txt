When the ER is stressed, BiP can be titrated away to bind to misfolded substrates, in turn activating Ire1 (see figure, step 1). Both enzymes contain catalytic RING domains and exhibit somewhat different preferences for unique E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes: Doa10-dependent ubiquitylation requires Ubc6 and Ubc7 (REF. Two models were proposed to explain this observation: either TCR subunits are targeted to an unknown compartment for degradation or a specific protease resides within the ER10. Two factors in this class, Rad23 and Dsk2, increase ERAD efficiency108,131. Furthermore, induction of the heat-shock response in yeast can compensate for ER stress that is caused by the overexpression of Cpy* in cells that lack inositol-requiring protein-1 (Ire1) (REF. Nevertheless, many original questions remain unanswered. In some cases, the two chaperone systems even have unique effects on the fate of a substrate50-53. ERDJ5 regulates the degradation of null Hong Kong (NHK), a disease-causing Î±1-antitrypsin variant, by accelerating the formation of degradation-competent NHK monomers from disulphide-linked dimers58.Because of the diversity of this enzyme family and the diversity of potential substrates, many questions remain unanswered.
