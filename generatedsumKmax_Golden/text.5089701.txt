Younger age and parental drinking problems were positively associated with hazardous drinking.In Model 2 (Table 2) we added the number of types of lifetime victimization. Victimization experienced only in childhood was not associated with higher odds of hazardous drinking (OR=1.01; CI=0.75-1.36) Despite showing somewhat lower risk of lifetime victimization than the other three sexual minority subgroups, rates of hazardous drinking and depression among mostly heterosexual women were more in line with rates reported by lesbian and bisexual women than those reported by exclusively heterosexual women. Thus, our pooling of data from the CHLEW and NSHLEW is both a strength and a limitation of the study. Thus, our pooling of data from the CHLEW and NSHLEW is both a strength and a limitation of the study. However, both the CHLEW and NSHLEW used a well-validated questionnaire designed to be sensitive to women's (including SMW's) lives and experiences. As such, limitations related to inferences about causality and temporal order must be considered when interpreting results. In addition, one participant identified as “queer” and another preferred not to be labeled; these two participants are not included in the analyses presented here.The CHLEW largely replicated the interview protocol used in the NSHLEW. We combined responses to four 12-month indicators of hazardous drinking: (1) heavy episodic drinking, (2) intoxication, (3) adverse drinking consequences and (4) symptoms of potential alcohol dependence. A similar question asked about frequency of subjective intoxication (“drinking enough to feel drunk—where drinking noticeably affected your thinking, talking, and behavior”). For example, NSHLEW participants who used descriptors such as “pushed me”, “grabbed me”, “hit me”, “beat me”’, “choked me”, and “kicked me” were coded as having experienced IPV.
