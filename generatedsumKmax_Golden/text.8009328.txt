ChemFETs often have chemically selective membranes comprised of PVC, PDMS, and occasionally NBR among other formulations [22,26–29]. Generally, the polymers alone have limited native sensitivity to ionic targets and their sensitivity/selectivity is be imparted by incorporating chemical recognition elements (CRE) into the polymer membranes to create the interfacial chemically selective material of the device.Tetraoctylammonium (TOA) was chosen as our CRE. NBR is also inert under the sample conditions and adheres to the gate oxide well enough to allow an operational lifetime of over 46 h. Potentiometric methods in particular have been poorly represented in environmental, petrochemical, and biological application spaces and provide an opportunity for continued development [12]. H2S has a pKa near 7 and is primarily present as its conjugate base, hydrosulfide (HS−), at physiological temperature and pH. The ChemFETs described in this work feature a polymer membrane formulated with a non-covalently associated HS− ionophore. They provide detection of HS− in real-time with selectivity over sulfur-containing compounds including cysteine and glutathione, which are common interferants in H2S measurements. 3.4.Electrode surface characterizationElemental composition and surface morphology were determined by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) using a ThermoFisher Helios Hydra Plasma FIB.
