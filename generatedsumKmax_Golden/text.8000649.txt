All animal experiments in this study were approved by the Houston Methodist Animal Care Committee in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines. Expression of transcription factors was determined by using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were then sent to Novogene Inc for low-input total RNA library construction using the SMRTER kit lib (Takara Inc Mountain View). The genes with RNA Integrity number (≥5.8) were further sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. The P values of skin-graft survival were determined with the Mann-Whitney test. 3.2 |Anti-male CD8+ T cells display an exhaustive phenotype in female recipients that received large but not small male skin graftsTo study the T cell states correlated with transplant outcome, female B6 recipients were transplanted with either large or small male tail skins, followed by flow cytometric analysis of anti-male H-2Db HY Uty tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood or spleens. Expression of Granzyme B, RORγt, IL-4, and IL-17A in TEa cells were not significantly different between 2 groups (Figure S3C).At 30 days post cell transfer, the majority of TEa cells in spleens of CB6F1 mice were CD62L−CD44+, whereas TEa cells in skin-graft recipients were heterogeneous in the expression of CD62L and CD44 (Figure S4A). Moreover, compared with TEa cells from skin-graft recipients, TEa cells from CB6F1 mice expressed significantly higher levels of TOX, NR4A1, NR4A2, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, CD39, and 2B4 (Figure 5C, Figure S4B).TEa cells were isolated from spleens of CB6F1 mice and skin-graft B6 recipients at 30 days post initial TEa cell transfer and then were further adoptively transferred into B6.Rag1−/− mice.
