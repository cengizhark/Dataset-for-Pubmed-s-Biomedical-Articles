3B PDGF-BB treatment resulted in inactivation of Bad with its coupling to protein 14-3-3. Based on our current findings we suggest a potential survival cascade that is initiated by PDGF/PDGF-R axis in gp120-exposed neurons. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated dementia (HAD) is a severe form of neurological impairment found in almost 20–30% of HIV-1 infected patients in the late stages of AIDS (Kolson & Gonzalez-Scarano, 2000). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated dementia (HAD) is a severe form of neurological impairment found in almost 20–30% of HIV-1 infected patients in the late stages of AIDS (Kolson & Gonzalez-Scarano, 2000). MaterialsHuman recombinant PDGF-BB was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and viral gp120 (IIIB strain) was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of National Institutes of Health. Cell purity was determined by immunocytochemistry using anti-MAP-2 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and were found to be >95% pure. Western blots were performed using the appropriate dilution of primary antibodies against the corresponding antigen (1:500 phospho-Akt, 1:200 phospho-PDGFβR, 1:200 phospho-GSK, 1:200 Bcl-xL, 1:200 Bax (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); 1:200 phospho-Bad ser136 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); 1:500 NF-κB (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); and 1:4000 β-actin (Sigma). Following the respective treatments, 50μl of medium was removed to a new multi-well plate to evaluate the LDH released into the medium. Each experiment consisted of three replicates and was repeated at least three times. Isolation of Cytochrome C and Cytochrome C ELISA AssayThe isolation of cytochrome C in the cytosolic fraction was performed using the Mitochondrial Fractionation Kit (Acive motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Cell supernatants were re-centrifuged at 11,000g for 20 min twice and the supernatant fractions were stored at −80°C for cytochrome C ELISA using the FunctionELISA™ Cytochrome C kit (Acive motif). One hundred microliter of HRP-conjugated streptavidin was them added following the removal of the detecting antibody and incubation continued for 1 hour. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Student t test.
