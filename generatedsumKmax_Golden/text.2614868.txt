Among these, 14/18 had complete LSL excision, but 4/18 lacked excision. 4b, animals H866, H868, H869, H871, and H872), and 9% (7/78) had insertion signals by intron PCR (Fig. The efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination is affected by several factors other than the promoter driving Cre expression (Sauer, 1998; Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007). To make pBSsmL1glob, the Î²-globin polyadenylation signal was PCR amplified from the plasmid pQX107, digested with BamHI/EcoRI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBSsmL1 to produce pBSsmL1glob. The CAG promoter and LSL cassette from pQX107 was removed with NotI/XmnI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and cloned into the BstZ17I sites of pBSsmL1GFPuv to make ORFeusLSL, which was sequencingly verified in its entirety. For doubly heterozygous G1 progeny of CAG-cre females, 5/12 displayed complete excision in the tail tissue examined (Fig. 2b, animals H784 and H883), 5/12 displayed a mosaic excision pattern, indicated by the presence of both floxed and excised alleles in the same tissue (Fig. Hence, the observed excision rate in doubly heterozygous G1 progeny was also much lower than that in the initial study which reported excision in 100% of such animals without mosaicism (Sakai and Miyazaki, 1997). With intron PCR, we detected intronless signal in the tail tissue of all animals that have undergone either complete (Fig. As expected, Cre-mediated excision could be detected in 3/3 pancreatic samples, 3/3 stomach samples, 2/3 duodenal samples, but none of several other tissues examined (Fig. Only the 1,370-bp intron-containing signal was detected in all tissues using the standard assay (not shown). Retrotransposition signals were detected in 3/3 pancreatic samples, 1/3 stomach and 1/3 duodenal samples but not in any other tissues examined (Fig. Thus L1 machinery is intact in somatic cells in which L1 is not normally expressed.
