Modulators of Microbiome in HealthAmong healthy individuals, certain factors such as age, culture, and geographic differences have shown variations in different parts of the microbiome.15,22 For example, one study has shown the presence of halophilic bacteria and soil bacteria, attributed to the consumption of salted or fermented food unique to a culture.16 Diet has also been shown to be an important modulator of the gut microbiota.23 A study examining children raised in a rural setting were found to have unique microbiome changes compared to children of the same ethnicity but raised in a more urban setting.24 High fiber, low fat diets were found to create an environment that promoted proper digestion, nutrient uptake, and healthy metabolism.21 Healthy habits and good hygiene help maintain an equilibrium in our microbiome.25–27 Disruptions such as dietary changes, poor hygiene, medications, and toxin ingestion such as tobacco and alcohol, can disrupt the equilibrium and increase susceptibility to different diseases.27–29 These imbalances lead to pH changes or alter the inflammatory response, increasing likelihood of non-commensal microbial colonization.In addition to modifiable factors, certain diseases lead to alterations in the human microbiome. There is limited data regarding the impact of PPI use on the oral microbiome.
