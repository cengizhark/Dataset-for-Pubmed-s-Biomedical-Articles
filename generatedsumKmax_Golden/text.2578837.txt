Spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion is a salient feature of all synapses (Fatt and Katz, 1952; Del Castillo and Katz, 1954) including those in synaptic networks in vivo (Pare et al , 1997; Pare et al , 1998; Chadderton et al , 2004). This construct is better localized to synaptic vesicles and manifests minimal surface fluorescence compared to the classical synaptophluorin, which is a fusion construct of synaptobrevin (Zhu et al , Society for Neuroscience Abstract 2004; (Granseth et al , 2006)) (Fig. For these imaging experiments we selected isolated 1 μm2 fluorescent puncta, which typically correspond to individual synapses (Liu et al , 1999). This estimate is in line with earlier work (Geppert et al , 1994; Murthy and Stevens, 1999; Sara et al , 2005) as well as our electrophysiological measurements in this study (Fig. Within the synaptic cleft we assumed a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 μm2/ms in accordance with several earlier estimates (Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998; Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003; Nielsen et al , 2004), whereas outside the cleft we assumed a diffusion coefficient of 0.75 μm2/ms. We think this last model brings together the “different synapses” and “ectopic release” models in one scheme that could account for our data as well as earlier observations (Townsend et al , 2003). For L-mode kinetics, the equations are similar except for the reaction rate constants were chosen according to the following kinetic scheme:(L­modeNMDAreceptor)CU⇔6034[C]CM⇔12017[C]C1⇔161127C2⇔2610580C3⇔21672508O1⇔6623449O2. This conclusion is also supported by several earlier studies that examined the properties of NMDA-mEPSCs in comparison to AMPA-mEPSCs (Umemiya et al , 1999; Groc et al , 2002; Dalby and Mody, 2003).
