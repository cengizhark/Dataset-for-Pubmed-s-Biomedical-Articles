Pharmacokinetic studiesPharmacokinetic studies were performed as previously described [24,26]. Animals and preparation of tissue samples21-week old male C57BL6 DIO mice were purchased from Jackson Labs. For mouse tissue, Gapdh was used as the reference gene. Fifty μg/ml working concentrations of the peptides were coupled to the beads overnight in 4C. Peptide bead conjugates and 25X GSK2033 or T0901317 at each respective concentration were added to appropriate wells. LXR-Peptide interactions were allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature then read using the Bio-Plex 200 system with suspension array platform and the data was assessed with xMAP technology [27–29]. 1B, GSK2033 dose-dependently suppressed basal transcription in full-length LXRα or full-length LXRβ cotransfection assays with IC50s of 17 nM and 9 nM, respectively. Both LXRs share a high degree of homology and act as cholesterol sensors, activated by cholesterol derivatives and regulate reverse cholesterol transport [1–7]. Given that many of these receptors are expressed in the liver, this could clearly underlie the unexpected results we observed on gene expression in this tissue. We found that SR9238, a liver selective LXR inverse agonist, effectively suppressed lipogenesis in a mouse model of NAFLD and effectively blocked hepatic steatosis even though the mice remained on a high fat diet [24].
