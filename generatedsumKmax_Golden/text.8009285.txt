The production of red macroalgae steadily increased annually, achieving the annual production of ~1.8 × 1010 kg in 20159. In addition, red macroalgae have the higher carbohydrate contents and simpler carbohydrate compositions than other marine algae1,2. At 0, 10, and 20 g/L AB, the cell concentrations obtained from strain D452-L124 were 1.85, 1.43, and 1.08 g/L at 24 h, respectively (Fig. Therefore, red macroalgae are regarded as feasible feedstocks for producing fuels and chemicals. Therefore, the initial cell concentration of strain D452-L124 was increased from 2 g/L (Fig. First, it could be due to the transglycosylation activity of β-galactosidase encoded by LAC4 introduced into S. cerevisiae. Transglycosylation activity in the GH family generally occurs at a high mass ratio of substrate to enzyme34, 35. 6b), and the peak of the product newly appeared at 275 m/z, which was detected at the same retention time of an authentic isosorbide standard (Fig. It was also confirmed that the mass spectrum of isosorbide acquired by the GC/MS analysis in the reaction product (Fig. Verduyn medium contains the following components/L: 10 g KH2PO4, 2.5 g MgSO4, 10 mL concentrated trace element solution, and 15 mL vitamin solution. AR enzyme assayTo assay AR enzyme activity, E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pET21α-GRE3 was cultivated in LB medium containing 50 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C and 200 rpm until the culture broth optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.5. The reaction mixture containing 2 mM substrates such as AHG, AB, galactose, or xylose, and 1 mM NADPH, and 0.35 mg/mL recombinant enzyme in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 30 °C. A fast protein liquid chromatography system (AKTA Prime, GE Healthcare) with Sephadex G-10 resin was used with distilled water as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. The samples were trimethylsilylated by adding 45 μL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The 1 μL derivatized sample was injected into the GC column in splitless mode. The oven temperature of the GC was programmed to initially be at 80 °C for 1 min before ramping to 300 °C at 10 °C/min for 1 min. All experiments were performed and recorded on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer operating at 900 MHz and at 298 K (Bruker, Billerica, MA). A total of 2048 and 128 complex points were recorded in the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively.
