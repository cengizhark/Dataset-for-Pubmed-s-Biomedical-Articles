LimitationsThere are several limitations to the results of this study. Although there was greater variability than the Quebec sample, the response probabilities for several items were highly skewed to ‘False’ (six-point False-True scale). ESEM is a structural equation modelling (SEM) method that allows researchers to combine exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a single model (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009; Marsh et al , 2009). The process involves several steps. We used SPSS 24 software for descriptive statistics and Mplus 7.0 software for the ESEM analysis.Given the ordinal nature of the SIMS variables, model parameter estimation employed a weighted least squares estimation technique (WLSMV) with robust standard errors, and a mean and variance adjusted chi-square (χ2) test statistic (Muthén, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997; Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2004). We evaluated our multivariate models for fit to the observed data using multiple indicators of model performance, including the χ2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), weighted root mean square residual (WRMR), standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (Jackson, Gillaspy, & Purc-Stephenson, 2009), along with substantive criteria (e.g., interpretability of factors). To account for missing data, Mplus estimates mean, variance and covariance parameters using a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimating procedure which employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, assuming data are missing at random (Muthén, 1998–2004a; 1998–2004b). Thus, cases with missing data on the covariates are not included in the analysis. Given only one eigenvalue > 1 (λ1=8.339) accounting for 60% of the variance, along with a scree plot (eigenvalue plot) elbow at 2 (also suggesting one factor), and 12 loadings ≥ 0.60, we selected the single factor solution as the best solution for these data. Indeed, findings of such research suggest that becoming a non-smoker involves adopting a non-smoker identity (Lindgren et al , 2016; Tombor, Shahab, Brown, & West, 2013; Tombor et al , 2015; Vangeli & West, 2012). Self-concept formation involves identifying with activities that become important to the individual (Wigfield & Karpathian, 1991).
