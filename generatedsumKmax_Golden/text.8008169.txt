This participant was provided with a headset that enabled her to hear with improved sound quality and increased her satisfaction of the program. Table 3 displays TUQ items and subscale scores. Rates of initiation after enrollment were not as high as targeted, mostly due to some individuals who enrolled in the program being discharged to a skilled nursing facility and not home. The immediate post-discharge period has been identified as a teachable moment and may be a time to engage and enhance patient activation, which has been associated with a decrease in hospital readmissions (Mitchell et al , 2014). Beginning contact with patients during hospitalization presents an opportunity to assess patientsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of their ability for self-management. Most participants completed the 1-hour sessions; however, one individual requested shorter sessions due to fatigue and inability to focus attention after long periods. Finally, it is unknown whether these results would persist and if there would be sustained improvements in knowledge and A1C level over time. This project included a trial of 1,665 beneficiaries randomized to either receiving nurse case manager telemedicine care every 4 to 6 weeks for 2 years or usual care. At 5 years, compared to the usual care group, those who received telemedicine case management had greater improvements in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and blood pressure (Shea et al , 2006). Electronic tablets with internet access were also provided to participants during the first home visit. Data CollectionData were collected in-person at enrollment and upon completion of the program and from review of the electronic health record (EHR). An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all tests of statistical significance.
