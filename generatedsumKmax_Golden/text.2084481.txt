The original dataset was divided into two halves, each containing three blocks of trials (near, middle, and far, in counterbalanced order), and the median RT, percentage errors, and IE scores were analysed with a mixed ANOVA as before, except now including the variable experiment half (first half, second half). Importantly, there were no significant interactions with the variable congruency - no changes in the magnitude or spatial distribution of multisensory interactions across the two halves of the experiment.The temporal modulations of the crossmodal congruency effects support the ‘general movement preparation’ hypothesis, and contradict both the ‘long-lasting modulation hypothesis’, and the ‘spatially-specific movement preparation hypothesis’.Following the suggestion of one of our reviewers, we also performed an additional experiment in which twenty-four new naïve participants directed a laser pointer at the distant tool use target (which was replaced with a 5mm diameter laser-detecting diode). However, it is not yet clear whether these different experimental approaches are equally applicable to understanding multisensory peripersonal space, or whether instead the choice of experimental design may affect the particular results obtained. Our series of tool use experiments have mostly followed what we term the ‘interleaved’ design of tool use experiments - individual tool use movement trials are interleaved with trials of the task used to measure peripersonal space (i.e., the crossmodal congruency task used in the present manuscript, and Holmes et al  2004; Maravita et al  2002b; see also Holmes et al  2007, for different designs). In order to assess the possible effects of covert (and uninstructed) tool use movement preparation on multisensory interactions in peripersonal space, we therefore manipulated the temporal and spatial predictability of the required tool use task and analysed crossmodal congruency effects on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, this interaction between trial order and congruency differed significantly between the two groups, F(3,171)=2.72, p<.05 (see Figure 3).
