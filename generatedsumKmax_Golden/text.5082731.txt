Median parasitemia was 2,195 parasites/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 810.75–4640.25 parasites/µL), with 11 patients (92%) treated with artemisinin combination therapy and one patient (8%) treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. As a positive control, 25 µL of a mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (PHA, final concentration 10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), was added into corresponding wells. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie near infrared (NIR) fixable viability kit (BioLegend) was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. Next, 100 µL of BD Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each well and incubated on ice for 20 min, protected from light. Then, 2 µg/mL (final volume of 50 µL) of intracellular antibody (IFNγ PeCy7 and IL-10 PE), diluted in BD Perm buffer was added per well and incubated on ice for 60 min, protected from light. Samples were generally acquired within 12–24 hr post-staining. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie NIR fixable viability kit was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. RNA concentration and quality were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. qPCRs were performed in duplicate, using the GoTaq qPCR kit for SYBR green (A6001; Promega) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad) per manufacturer’s instructions.
