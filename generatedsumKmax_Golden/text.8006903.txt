The first line begins with @, and contains the name of the read. The genome can then be split into transcribed units.Determine the total number of mappable reads in the library, the total number of reads mapping to rRNA, and the total number of reads mapping to coding sequences using a custom script. Second is the addition of a selection for truncated cDNAs, which should be enriched in CMC dependent stops at Ψ residues.The ability of next-generation sequencing to provide transcriptome wide data provides Pseudo-seq with several advantages over the classic primer extension assay used for Ψ mapping. However, Pseudo-seq can be used to identify Ψs in all transcripts, Second, next-generation sequencing provides sufficient coverage for Ψ identification in transcripts of a range of abundances. Pseudouridine, the C5-glycoside isomer of uridine, is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification found within cellular RNAs owing to its presence at multiple positions in both rRNAs and tRNAs (Ge and Yu, 2013) (Fig. It should be noted that strains deleted for pseudouridylation factors can be used as biological replicates alongside wild-type replicates.The parameters used for Ψ calling during data analysis are also important.
