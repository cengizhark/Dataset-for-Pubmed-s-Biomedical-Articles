Under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, we obtained similar results for the molecular weights of Ryk. Neurons were cultured for 2–3 days after transfection before the turning assays were carried out. In the example shown in Fig. This treatment also partially attenuated calcium activity in 4/6 experiments, reducing the frequency of calcium transients from 9.0/hr to 0.8/hr after the addition of SKF96365 (Fig. Thus, as has been shown for other guidance cues such as netrin-1 and BDNF (Gomez and Zheng, 2006), calcium signaling is required for both of these Wnt induced behaviors. Moreover, pharmacologically inhibiting PLC which is known to act upstream of IP3, eliminates the growth promoting effects of Wnt5a whereas a PLC agonist mimicked the effects of Wnt5a, confirming that 2-APB blocks the IP3 pathway. Wnt proteins are highly conserved secreted morphogens that play important roles during embryogenesis (Ciani and Salinas, 2005). The pseudocolored calibration bar indicates ratiometric intensity ranging from 100% of baseline calcium activity (black) to 175% (white). Scale bars in all figures=50μm. In experiments comparing 2 treatments and in turning assays the Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis. Phase images of live cells were acquired with the Nikon microscope at 1 min intervals to record growth cone behaviors. To minimize the effects of any morphological changes that could affect fluorescence measurements through changes in volume, the baseline (F0) was calculated as a shifting average of the fluorescence intensity over a 5-min window. Calcium signals (R/R0) were then measured as the percentage change from a shifting average baseline (R0) of the ratiometric measurements as described above for nonratiometric measurements.
