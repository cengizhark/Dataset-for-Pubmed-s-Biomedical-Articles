According to one such study, 20 ng muscimol delivered in a larger (1 μl) infusion volume than that used in the present study impairs electrophysiological activity directly and indirectly, via the inhibition of postsynaptic neurons, in a 1-mm radius (Arikan et al  2002). The apparent discrepancy between this and the present findings may be related to the maintenance of CS-induced and context-induced reinstatement by conditioned reinforcers and occasion setters, respectively. These brain regions include the BLA, dmPFC, dorsolateral caudate-putamen (dlCPu), and the reciprocally connected VTA (Heimer et al  1991; McDonald 1991; Crombag et al  2002; Heidbreder and Groenewegen 2003; McLaughlin and See 2003; Fuchs et al  2005; Fuchs et al  2007). Rats were maintained on 20–25 g of rat chow per day, with water available ad libitum. In cocaine users, craving and resumption of drug use can be precipitated by exposure to drug-associated cues, stress, or drug itself (Jaffe et al  1989; Childress et al  1993; O'Brien et al  1998; Sinha 2001). SurgeryForty-eight hours after food training, rats were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine (66.6 and 1.3 g/kg, respectively, intraperitoneal). Chronic indwelling catheters were constructed using a bent-steel cannula with a screw-type connector (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA), SILASTIC tubing (10 m, inner diameter 0.64 m, outer diameter 1.19 m, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA), Prolite monofilament mesh (Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH, USA), and cranioplastic cement, as described previously (Fuchs et al  2007). Rats had no exposure to these contextual stimuli prior to cocaine self-administration training. The stimuli were presented throughout each session independent of responding, as in our previous studies (Fuchs et al  2005; Fuchs et al  2007). During the adaptation procedure, stainless steel injection cannulae (33 G, Plastics One) were bilaterally inserted into the rat's guide cannulae to a depth of 2 mm below the tip of the guide cannulae. Intracranial MicroinfusionsFor intracranial microinfusions, the injection cannulae were connected to 10-μl Hamilton syringes (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) that were mounted on an infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). In the present study, muscimol was administered at 12 ng/0.3 μl; thus, the area of neural inactivation was significantly smaller due to reduced infusion volume. Similar information about the spread of baclofen hydrobromide is not available, but its spread is likely limited by low lipophilicity (Leisen et al  2003). Immediately after microinfusion, horizontal locomotor activity was measured in novel Plexiglas chambers (42×20×20 cm high), as described previously (Fuchs et al  2007). Rats were then transcardially perfused using 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Fisher Scientific) and 10% formaldehyde solution (Sigma).
