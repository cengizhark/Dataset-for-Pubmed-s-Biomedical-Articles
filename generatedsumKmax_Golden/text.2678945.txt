While a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in mTRPA1-transfected cells revealed activation at concentrations below 100 μM menthol, Ca2+ levels declined in a concentration-dependent manner above 100 μM. 2B, left panel, green trace). The Region Spanning Transmembrane Domain 5 and Transmembrane Domain 6 (TM5-TM6) Determines the Distinct Sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to MentholTo systematically identify the molecular basis underlying the distinct sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to menthol, we constructed chimeras between the two channels. In contrast, hTRPA1-mTM1-6, a chimera constructed by introducing the transmembrane region from mTRPA1 into hTRPA1 (Fig. 6B-E and Table 1).Sequence alignment of TRPA1 from different species revealed that TRPA1 from Anopheles gambiae (mosquito-TRPA1) and Takifugu (fugu-TRPA1), like dTRPA1, do not have Ser and Thr at these two positions (Fig. One hypothesis is that the TM5 domain may constitute a binding site for menthol. A,B, mTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (A,0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (B, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). G, hTRPA1 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (G, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (H, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). I, J, hTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell attached patch configuration (I, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette/ 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (J, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). AP18 does not form glutathione adducts as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)ESI-MS spectra of glutathione (GSH) alone (A) or reacted with either MO (B) or AP18 (C). In some experiments, the pipette contained 100 nM free Ca2+ buffered by BAPTA (1 mM): 130 methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl2, 0.483 CaCl2, 1 BAPTA-K salt, 10 hemi Na-HEPES (pH7.3 with CsOH).TRPA1 activity was usually monitored using repetitive voltage ramps (at 5 sec intervals) in the whole cell configuration. To quantify the effects of TRPA1 modulators on TRPA1 activity, averaged inward currents at -120 mV and averaged (over the first ∼5 msec) outward currents at +120 mV were measured (see Fig. Cells in whole cell configuration were challenged with a voltage step protocol to investigate the current-voltage relationship for TRPA1 activation by voltage. Prior to rupturing the patch to achieve a whole cell recording, voltage protocols were applied to the cell-attached patch and voltage-dependent activation of TRPA1 channel activity was monitored (Supplementary Fig. Briefly, equimolar concentrations of TRPA1 modulators and glutathione (Sigma) were mixed in water and reacted at room temperature for two hours. The complex was subject to molecular dynamics simulation under periodic boundary conditions (90 Å × 90 Å × 100 Å).
