We found that both antibodies recognized a protein(s) in untreated and LPS treated cell extracts that is involved in complexes on region I (data not shown) and II (Fig. Through EMSA we have shown that AaDefA1 regions I and II bind NF-κB/Rel-type proteins. Actin 5C-Renilla transfection control plasmid was adjusted for sets of experiments (10–100 ng) such that Renilla activities were not less than 1% of firefly luciferase activities. Dual-luciferase reporter assaysFirefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo system (Promega). Briefly, cells were lysed in 24 well plates with 75 μl PBS and 75 μl luciferase reagent and transferred to a white 96 well plate to measure firefly luciferase activity. Aag2 cells were treated with 100 mg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 16 h prior to extraction for LPS treated extracts. We previously isolated an AgDef1 genomic clone and here we isolated two AaDefA genes. aegypti Defensin sequences were isolated from genomic clones of the Liverpool strain. Very similar patterns of up-regulation were obtained following the treatment of all transfections with either heat killed bacteria (Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus) or peptidoglycan (data not shown). Immune stimulation with M. luteus produced similar results (data not shown).
