The nephrotoxicity of neomycin is associated with selective accumulation in the kidney where the cortical levels may reach as high as 20 times those of circulating levels in serum. Indeed we did not see any acute or chronic adverse side effects in experiments with these mice. AKT kinase activity is frequently elevated in prostate cancers (35). In these mice, expression of AKT in the ventral prostate results in activation of the p70S6K pathway and induction of PIN similar in character to that observed in PTEN+/− mice (36). Mutation of PTEN leads to deregulated PI3K signaling, resulting in constitutive activation of downstream targets including the AKT kinase family. This class of mRNAs includes ribosomal proteins, elongation factors 1A1 and 1A2, and several other proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis or in translation control (41). Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Tissue sections of 4 μm were hydrated, incubated for 30 min with 3% H2O2 in methanol at RT, washed with H2O and PBS, and microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 10 min. Digoxigenin-labeled probes were generated by in vitro transcription from the above PCR templates using Digoxigenin RNA labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridization was carried out in the same buffer as prehybridization but containing 800 ng/ml digoxigenin labeled probe at 45 °C for 16 h. After successive washing in 4 × SSC (1 min at RT), 50% formamide in 2 × SSC/(1 h at 45 °C), 0.1 × SSC (2 h at 45 °C), TTBS (5 min at RT), the hybridization signal was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrate. Silver staining of nucleolar organizer region (NOR)Formalin-fixed tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol and H2O, immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and autoclaved in at 120 °C for 20 min.
