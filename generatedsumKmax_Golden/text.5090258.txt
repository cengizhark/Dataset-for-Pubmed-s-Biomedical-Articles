Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants from the two families. Family AP188 (figure 1A) was recruited from a remote village in Sindh province, Pakistan, and had four individuals (VI-1, VI-2, VI-4, VI-5) presenting with tightly curled scalp hairs (figure 1C–E). Of 176 homozygous variants, only two variants had MAF <0.01 in South Asian alleles in ExAC: a synonymous FAM134C NM_178126.3:c.906T>C variant that is heterozygous in 89 out of 16 512 South Asian ExAC alleles (MAF=0.005) and in two ExAC alleles of other ethnicity; and a missense variant c.950T>C (p.(Leu317Pro)) within KRT25 (NM_18154.3) that is heterozygous in three ExAC South Asian alleles (MAF=0.0002), but was not identified in 104 876 ExAC alleles of other ethnicity. Sanger sequencing of the KRT25 missense variant using DNA samples from the remaining members of AP188 and AP216 confirmed segregation with the ARWH phenotype in both families (figure 1A, B, see online supplementary figure S1A). The observation of sparse WH in affected individuals who are homozygous for the KRT25 c.950T>C variant recapitulates the phenotype in mutant mice. The KRT25 transcript and the encoded protein are expressed in all three layers of the follicle IRS and the hair shaft medulla.3 Likewise, other type I keratins namely KRT27 and KRT28 have the same expression pattern, while of the type II keratins, only KRT71 is expressed in all three IRS layers.3 The WH phenotype observed in individuals homozygous for the KRT25 c.950T>C variant implies that heterodimerisation between K25 and K71 is essential for stable hair structure, and is not compensated by interaction of K71 with K27 or K28. The variant is predicted to disrupt the α-helical rod 2B domain of K25 and to interfere with heterodimerisation with type II keratins, which are expected to lead to irregular and fragile hair that is characteristic of the WH phenotype. The identification of a KRT25 mutation as a cause of WH in humans can help direct efforts in the development of therapies for hair keratin disorders.1
