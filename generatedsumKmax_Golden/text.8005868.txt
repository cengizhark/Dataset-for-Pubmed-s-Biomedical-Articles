PC provider had 12.7 times the odds of responding favorably to this question post-implementation compared to UCC providers, even after controlling for pre-implementation survey responses to the same question (p = 0.005). For this question, PC providers had 7.6 times the odds of responding favorably post-implementation compared to UCC providers after controlling for pre-implementation survey responses to the same question (p = 0.007). Most others, however, valued any efforts to save even a few minutes of time. Though changing telephones may seem like a trivial change, it had a profound impact on the clinics in this study and this impact has important implications for health systems. Though prior research has been performed on the topic of physician culture and behavior [56–59], little is known about the professional culture of Medical Assistants, the individuals who performed the intervention. This may play an especially important role for MAs given their cultural diversity [68, 69]. “Overcoming gaps in power and status” can be one of the greatest challenges facing organizations transforming MAs into clinical leadership roles [71]. Setting and ParticipantsThe study was conducted in six primary care clinics at an urban safety net hospital; two clinics were used as pilot clinics (PC) and four clinics as usual care clinics (UCC). Two coders (JM and DW) coded all interviews using data-driven codes [46], met to review coding and establish agreement, and then each coded the remainder of the interviews independently. We also examined the association between providers in PCs versus UCCs and favorable post-implementation survey responses (i.e., answers of “Completely Agree” or “Somewhat Agree”). Specifically, we performed adjusted logistic regression analyses for each survey question, testing models that examined whether practicing in a PC versus UCC was an independent predictor of favorable post-implementation survey responses, controlling for pre-implementation survey responses to the same question.This project was approved by the Boston University Medical Center Internal Review Board. We received surveys from 21 (95%) PC and 40 (87%) UCC providers pre-implementation, and 19 (86%) PC and 37 (80%) UCC providers post-implementation. Established Teams, Roles, and WorkflowsProviders and MAs described high-functioning clinical teams, with established roles, relationships, and workflows for team members. Several MAs felt they could easily adapt routines to incorporate the new workflow: “But I think if you know how to manage your time, you’ll be okay…It becomes like second nature to you” (MA 2).
