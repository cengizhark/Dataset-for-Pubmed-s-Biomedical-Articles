3-5, which compare the phylogenies of the three genes. It is noteworthy that this R. felis sequence is also partly responsible for the conflict between gene trees described above.Further support for recombination within the alignments comes from the Reticulate test. Although linkage disequilibrium declines with distance in all three genes, there is only consistent statistical support for this relationship in the case of PS120 (Table 7). 6) Such recombinant sequences can result in the recovery of trees that do not reflect the true phylogeny of either parental sequence (David and Keith 2002). Tree ReconstructionThe phylogenetic trees of these genes were reconstructed by maximum likelihood with the program PAUP* v.4.0b8 (Swofford 1998). The null distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic (2Δl, where Δl is the difference between the log-likelihood scores of the two models) can be approximated using the χ2 distribution with the degrees of freedom being the difference in the number of free parameters between the two models (two when comparing M7 and M8 and four when comparing M0 and M3). 1 and 2) was calculated as the average of the ω ratios across the all the ω classes from model 8, with the posterior probabilities used as weights. The ω ratio of the PS120 encoding gene is highly heterogeneous across codons (M1 vs M3; Tables 4 and 5).
