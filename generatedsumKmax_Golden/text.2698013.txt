In fact, the neuron's average level of activity during sustained extrafoveal tracking (Figure 3E) appeared very similar to its average level of activity during passive viewing of the moving bars (Figure 3C), even though the bar inside the response field was used to guide tracking in one condition but could be ignored in the other.Qualitatively similar observations were made for the sample neuron in the right column of Figure 3 (B,D,F), with the exception that this second neuron did not exhibit a strong sensory response to stimulus onsets inside its response field (Figure 3B).Thus, for the two sample neurons of Figure 3 - both representing the location of the peripheral visual stimulus guiding extrafoveal tracking - there was no apparent selective increase in activity when the stimulus inside their response fields was actively used to guide the behavior as opposed to when it was passively viewed. We quantified the width of this distribution by obtaining a Gaussian function fit for the data (equation 2), and we found that the standard deviation of this fit - a measure of the spatial distribution - was ~3.25Â°. Expressed in SC anatomical coordinates as in (Munoz & Wurtz, 1995b), this value translates into ~0.81 mm from the rostral pole of the SC, which is similar to earlier estimates with a similar behavioral task (see in particular Figure 7H and Figure 12 of Munoz & Wurtz, 1995b). In a related study, we validate this prediction (Hafed et al , 2008). Specifically, OPN's may use the projections that they receive from the SC in order to detect imbalances in SC activity, not whether or not the rostral SC is active. We found a spatial spread during fixation of a single stationary spot that was similar to that reported earlier for a similar behavior (Munoz & Wurtz, 1995b). Spatial accuracy was not enforced during the initial grace period in order to allow the monkeys enough time to initiate their tracking. The parameters A, Bx, and By were chosen to be 3, 1.4, and 1.8, respectively (Quaia et al , 1998). Smooth pursuit gain across sessions was 0.75 +/- 0.01 s.e.m., and the average smooth pursuit phase lag was 0.3 ms +/- 0.9 ms s.e.m.
