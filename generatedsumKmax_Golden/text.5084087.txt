However, exchange peaks were readily detected between the two conformers in the NOESY spectra, which facilitated assignment of key resonances at the protein-protein interface for the second conformer including the methyl bearing side chains of Leu207, Leu211, Ile216, Leu220, and Thr222, the Hα/Hβ resonances of Asp219, the Hδ/Hε resonances of Tyr209, among others (Supplementary Table S1). Because exchange-relayed NOEs were also observed in this spectrum (e.g. Advances in NMR instrumentation and methodology over the past couple of decades have shaped our views regarding the amplitudes and timescales of motion in macromolecules and their impact on biological function.1-3 A recurring theme to emerge from these studies is the propensity of these molecules to sample high energy states, in addition to a dominant ground-state conformation. It could also explain the line broadening effects witnessed for a subset of HID resonances at the interface. Finally, we note that conformational homogeneity by NMR is commonly evaluated based on the characteristics of 1H-15N correlated spectra; studies of the Sds3-Sin3A interaction described herein serve a cautionary tale in that heterogeneity could be manifest in more subtle ways.
