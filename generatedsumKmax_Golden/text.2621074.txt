Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 was detected at 15 min, which persisted for 1 h in the case of STAT-1 (Fig. Modest induction of SOCS-1 mRNA was observed upon treatment with OSM, which was elevated in the STAT-3 siRNA cells at 1 h (2-fold), 2 h (2.2-fold), and 4 h (6.2-fold) (Fig. Concentrations of 1 μM and above significantly inhibited SOCS-3 mRNA expression, and maximal inhibition was seen at 20 μM (Figs. Deletion of the region containing the medial AP-1 element (Δ3), and an NF-κB and Sp1 site (Δ4) had no significant effect on OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity compared with the WT construct. In construct Δ5, deletion of the proximal AP-1 element reduced OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity by ~48% compared with Δ4. Deletion of the distal GAS element (GAS #1) (Δ6) did not significantly affect OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity compared to Δ5. As well, the proximal Sp1 element is deleted in construct Δ7.Activated STAT protein complexes bind to GAS elements in the promoters of STAT-responsive genes (Bromberg and Darnell 2000). Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate individual mutations in each of the GAS elements to better define their contributions in SOCS-3 promoter activity (Fig. To determine histone modifications in response to OSM, ChIP assays were performed using Abs against the acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4. These results indicate that all three elements, proximal AP-1, GAS #1, and GAS #2, are important for optimal OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity. A rat model of neurite outgrowth in primary sensory neurons demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated delivery of SOCS-3 inhibited neurite growth. The pharmacological inhibitors for MEK-1/MEK-2 (U0126), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), JAK-2 (AG 490) and negative control compounds (U0124 and SB202474), were purchased from Calbiochem Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The structure of the SOCS proteins consists of a central SH2 domain, a C-terminal 40 amino acid motif termed the SOCS box, and an N-terminal region of variable length. The deletion constructs are named as follows: Δ1, which lacks the distal AP-1 and C/EBP site; Δ2, which lacks two GATA-1 elements and a p300 site; Δ3, which lacks the medial AP-1 element; Δ4, which lacks two Sp1 sites and an NF-κB site; Δ5, which lacks the proximal AP-1 site; Δ6, which lacks the distal GAS element; and Δ7, which lacks the proximal GAS and Sp1 elements. Astrocytes (1 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates and incubated with DharmaFECT 1 reagent alone or with 100 nM cyclophilin B, siCONTROL or STAT-3 specific siRNAs following the manufacturer’s recommendations. After 72 h of transfection, 30 μg of cell lysate was subjected to immunoblotting for cyclophilin B, STAT-3 and actin as described above. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated with 200 mM NaCl at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-links. The primer pair 5′-GCTTTGTCTCCCTCTCGGTGAGT-3′ and 5′-AGTGTAGAGTCAGAGTTAGAGCC-3′ was used to amplify a 230-bp region in the mouse SOCS-3 promoter containing the proximal AP-1 element, two GAS elements, and an Sp1 element.
