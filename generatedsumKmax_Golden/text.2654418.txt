No phosphorylation of Y142 could be detected in samples from intact mice (Fig 4B). β-catenin activity is regulated by phosphorylation followed by degradation. β-catenin activity is regulated by phosphorylation followed by degradation. Increased levels of β-catenin combined with decreased Tcf3/Lef would provide more β-catenin protein to be recruited by AR. The syntheses of cDNA and biotinylated cRNA were performed according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The immunofluorescence staining of proteins was detected using a Zeiss Axioplan-2 Fluorescence Microscope (Zeiss, Toronto, ON, Canada). To characterize the status of the AR pathway in castrate resistant prostate cancer, a hierarchical two-dimensional clustering algorithm that was based on similarity of expression patterns was applied to 1092 genes previously identified to be differentially expressed in response to androgen in LNCaP cells maintained in cell culture (26).
