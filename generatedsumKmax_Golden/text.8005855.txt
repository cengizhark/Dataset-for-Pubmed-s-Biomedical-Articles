Given the high standardization of neuroimaging data reports and in particular the ubiquitous adherence to standard coordinate systems (such as the MNI system), the results reported in these studies can be readily compared with each other with respect to the spatial location of significant neural activity. The parameters of the model that best translate the input functions based on the experimental design into the measured time-series may be estimated by Bayesian inversion. Moreover, although model selection may allow to identify the most likely model given the measured data, inference is evidently limited to the models included into the comparison which may only reflect a small proportion of the potential full model space. Given the dynamic of the field and the constantly evolving methods and modeling approaches, the reader may be referred to the methodological papers describing the various methods for modeling diffusion directions and performing tractography.45-49 Such parameters also reflect the probability of how likely it is to reach that particular target in a random journey along the principle diffusion directions relative to all other possible locations that could be reached.
