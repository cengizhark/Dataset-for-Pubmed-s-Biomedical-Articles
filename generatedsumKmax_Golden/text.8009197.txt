However, upon addition of 70 mM glucose at pH 7.8, the cell-repulsive state was turned on due to the competitive glucose binding on the surface. Moreover, D-glucose could be used as a competitor and block the binding sites of PFP-PBA, thereby turning off the cell membrane imaging.Concerning the multiple diols in the complex structures of carbohydrates, in some cases, the specific binding mode is important for further applications. 4.4Cell culture and deliveryDuring the last decade, hydrogels with high water content and optimal 3D structures have been playing important roles in mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to improved performances in cell delivery and cell culture compared to the corresponding 2D environments. In the linear case, homo- or hetero-ditopic complementary building blocks are adopted, whereas tritopic or even tetratopic components are required for construction of cross-linked polymers. 4.1Gene deliveryThe non-covalent recognition of nucleic acids by synthetic vectors requires combining multiple weak electrostatic interactions in order to achieve a stable interaction in biological media. This multivalent binding is best achieved using macromolecules such as polymers87–90 and dendrimers.91 Nucleic acids condensation92 is a complex multi-step process (interaction, complexation, folding) that results in the formation of “polyplexes” nanoparticles that can penetrate cells and deliver functional nucleic acids like pDNA, siRNA or mRNA, provided they have appropriate sizes and surface charges. Normally, strategies such as protein engineering and chemical modification are required to improve enzyme performances, but long-term screening processes are usually required.
