The C-terminal extension of Lsm4 interacts directly with the 3′ end of the histone mRNP and this interaction is required for efficient histone mRNA degradation [13]. Multiple oligouridylation events may be required for 3′–5′ degradation of histone mRNAs on polyribosomes [16]. 2 3′ Adenylation affects RNA synthesis and degradation 2.2 Adenylation of mRNAIn eukaryotic cells, the cotranscriptional addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3′ ends of mRNA molecules is nearly universal; the poly(A) tail protects mRNAs from degradation and facilitates their translation from yeast to higher eukaryotes [1]. Pre-mRNA degradation may represent a secondary role for RNA adenylation in mammals. Following the oligouridylation event, the heteroheptameric Lsm1–7 complex binds to the oligo(U) tail to trigger subsequent histone mRNA degradation via both 5′–3′ and 3′–5′ RNA decay pathways [10,12]. Uridylation and/or adenylation are universal and conserved RNA modifications that have major impacts on the degradation, synthesis and mode of action of RNAs.
