It has been hypothesized that DA facilitates the learning of environmental contingencies by mediating plasticity mechanisms that strengthen or weaken corticostriatal inputs associated with reward delivery (Wickens et al , 1996; Schultz et al , 1997; Reynolds et al , 2001; Reynolds and Wickens, 2002; Wickens et al , 2003; Schultz, 2006). Recent studies indicate a potential role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in the NAcc in appetitive Pavlovian learning (Shiflett et al , 2008). No significant D1-mediated increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 positive neurons was seen in the dorsal striatum, consistent with published results (Gerfen et al , 2002). The role of DA in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning has been studied extensively (Schultz, 1998; Dalley et al , 2002; Eyny and Horvitz, 2003; Day et al , 2007). Reports that either D1 or NMDA receptor antagonism can inhibit appetitive Pavlovian learning (Di Ciano et al , 2001; Eyny and Horvitz, 2003) are consistent with this view. The reward pathway is often implicated in impulsive choice behavior (Belin et al , 2008). Recent studies have identified non-cAMP dependent DA receptor signaling pathways in MSNs mediating DA dependent behaviors (Beaulieu et al , 2005).
