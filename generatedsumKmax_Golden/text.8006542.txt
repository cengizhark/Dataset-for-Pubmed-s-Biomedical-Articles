Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the time of liver biopsy was defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) >6.4%, oral glucose tolerance test with plasma glucose >200 mg/dL at 2 hours, or confirmation of T2DM diagnosis by an endocrinologist.Typical clinical indications for liver biopsy at our institutions include concerns for: (1) severe NAFLD, as evidenced by: (a) persistently (3-6 months) elevated ALT and/or lack of improvement in serum ALT levels after appropriate implementation of lifestyle changes with subsequent BMI z-score improvements; (b) cardiometabolic risk factors associated with more severe NAFLD, such as type 2 diabetes or OSA; (c) evidence of splenomegaly and/or increased liver stiffness on magnetic resonance elastography); or (2) concern for a secondary underlying liver disease (eg, AIH due to positive autoantibodies with elevated serum immunoglobulin G levels).The classification developed by the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network was used to score severity of steatosis (scored 0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3), hepatocyte ballooning (0-2) and fibrosis (0-4), and the NAS was calculated (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning; range 0-8).14 A NAS of â‰¥5 was used to distinguish those with mild vs severe liver disease during the analyses. Significant fibrosis in this pediatric cohort was defined as fibrosis at or above stage 2. 2.2| Statistical analysesDescriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges [IQRs] for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) were used to present the demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort. 2.2| Statistical analysesDescriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges [IQRs] for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) were used to present the demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata MP v.14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). This finding suggests that either the proposed hypothesis by Loria et al is false, or that it does not apply to pediatric NAFLD. Following exclusion of conditions such as viral hepatitis B or C infections, autoantibody positivity alone can be sufficient evidence for clinicians to proceed with a liver biopsy, considering that autoimmune hepatitis is the second most common diagnosis made in children with overweight or obese BMI and suspected NAFLD, and should not be missed.1 Conversely, in the absence of autoantibody positivity, at our institutions, patients undergo liver biopsies if there are concerns that they may have more severe NAFLD (steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis), as suggested by the presence of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, T2DM etc. Of fundamental value is the multicenter nature of the study design, as with the reporting of data from multiple centers, the results are more generalizable to other pediatric centers.
