In that study there were three maskers, all 30-Hz wide and centered on the 4thâ€“6th harmonics of 100, and the signal to be detected was a pure tone at one or more of those frequencies; all signals were presented at equal amplitude and with random starting phase. These comparisons suggest that fixing signal phase and level across frequency eliminates CMR and may elevate threshold above that obtained with a multi-frequency signal presented in random noise. All observers were practiced in psychoacoustical tasks at the outset of the experiment, having participated in at least one prior experiment. One observer had previously participated in Experiment 1.2. Masker amplitude modulation, when present, was synchronized to the listening interval, such that the modulation in each 400-ms listening interval began in sine phase.3. Masker amplitude modulation, when present, was synchronized to the listening interval, such that the modulation in each 400-ms listening interval began in sine phase.3. The track continued for a total of 8 reversals, and threshold was estimated as the average signal level at the last 6 track reversals.Single-frequency thresholds were collected first and in random order blocked by frequency. The differences in outcome between the experiments may well arise because of stimulus differences. Data on detection of multi-frequency signals have been interpreted as discriminating between potential cues in CMR. All observers were practiced in psychoacoustical tasks at the outset of the experiment, having participated in at least one prior experiment.2. Those intervals were marked visually and separated by 250 ms.
