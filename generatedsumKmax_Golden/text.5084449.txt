However, caregivers almost unanimously reported wanting to receive such services, whereas only half of the patients reported that their caregiver would be interested in receiving services, and many patients felt that it would be difficult for their caregiver to find time to do so.These results add to the growing body of literature that documents the underutilization of mental health services by ICs (Vanderwerker et al , 2005), which often continues into bereavement (Cherlin et al , 2007; Lichtenthal et al , 2011). Additional information regarding patientsâ€™ concurrent appointments (i.e., Did they travel to MSKCC just for psychotherapy? ICs face unique challenges in making meaning, and palliative care researchers have acknowledged that finding meaning in the caregiving experience leads to better mental health among caregivers and, in turn, the provision of better care for the patient (Park et al , 2010). Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP), an existential therapeutic model developed by our group (Breitbart et al , 2010; 2012), addresses the existential issues of suffering, guilt, and death. ICs are at risk for a range of psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression, hopelessness) (Kissane et al , 1994; Dumont et al , 2006) and physical (e.g., increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, poor immune functioning, sleep difficulties) (Christakis & Allison, 2006; Rohleder et al , 2009) complications. Participants and ProceduresParticipants were recruited from the outpatient counseling center in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between July 6 and August 2, 2011. MeasuresThe questionnaires used for the study from which these data were drawn were developed by the Psychotherapy Laboratory in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and included both open- and closed-ended questions. Additionally, the time caregivers devote to providing care often prevents them from working full-time paid jobs; caregiving activities (i.e., transportation, medical supplies) are often costly, and, therefore, it is not surprising that caregivers and patients both reported that financial concerns were the third most common correlate of burden among caregivers.One fifth of caregivers reported concerns with guilt, issues with their role/sense of identity, and self-care, but very few reported concerns with their sense of purpose or meaning in life.
