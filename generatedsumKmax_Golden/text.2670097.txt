Although both of them inhibit the proliferation of multiple human breast cancer cell lines in culture, the potency in killing cancer cells and the water solubility remain to be improved for better efficacy.

Although multiple combined modality treatment strategies are available and continue to be improved, seeking for alternative therapeutics with a better therapeutic index remains a top priority of the drug development endeavors. Upon removal of the benzoyl groups from INH1 and INH2, the resultant thiazolyl amine 3 and 4 did not exhibit any anti-proliferative activity even at > 40 μM, indicating that benzoyl moiety is indispensable. Additionally, deletion of the para-methoxyl group in INH2 resulted in the dramatic loss of bioactivity (7) and replacement of the methoxyl group in 7 with trifluoromethyl group would efficiently improve the bioactivity by approximately 1.5-2 fold (8). Importantly, overexpression of Hec1 has been documented to associate with poor clinical outcomes of primary breast cancers as well as cases with multiple cancers 5, 6.
