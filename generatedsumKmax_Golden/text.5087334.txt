There are multiple settings in which this could have therapeutic benefit. There are multiple settings in which this could have therapeutic benefit. Tube formation and Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)Tube formation assays were performed on growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel™ Matrix (BD Biosciences) and visualized using either phase contrast microscopy or fluorescence microscopy after staining with ActinRed™ 555 ReadyProbes® reagent (Life Technologies). Assessment of pulmonary vascular leakageMice were perfused with Evans blue dye, administered through the external jugular vein, and treated ± TRAP-6. Extravascular Evans blue dye was quantified from perfused, excised lungs using formamide extraction and spectrophotometric quantification at 620 and 740 nm. Statistical analysisWhen experiments involved only two conditions, differences in means were evaluated for statistical significance using one- or two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test, as appropriate. In the latter case, significant differences between treatments were assessed using Tukey’s test, while Dunnet’s test was used to compare each individual treatment to controls. Sidak’s correction was used to account for multiple testing. Taken together, the findings described here suggest that pharmaceutical targeting of MALT1 protease activity may have broader implications than previously expected. Cells were imaged over a 2-minute period immediately before the addition of thrombin, and then again either immediately after addition (Figures 3C-3E), or following a 5-minute delay (Figure S5B and S5C).
