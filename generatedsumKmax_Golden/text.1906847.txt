Within 1-2 days in culture the BL-CFC first proliferates to form a tight core of cells. 6B) dramatically reduced the number of myeloid colonies formed and to a lesser extent the number of mixed colonies. Interestingly, in this condition the number of small primitive erythroid colonies did not alter; however, there appeared to be a decrease in the number of larger definitive erythroid colonies formed in the presence of LY294002. This begins to shed light on the signals required for expansion and differentiation of the BL-CFC, about which little is known. Colony assaysEmbryoid bodies were harvested, washed in PBS (Invitrogen) and trypsinized for 3 minutes at 37°C. Immunobloting was performed using primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution: rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognising dual phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235/236 (anti-P-S6, Cell Signal Technologies, 2211) or SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) or goat polyclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Santa Cruz, sc-20357). Non-specific binding to Fc receptors was blocked by incubation with mouse anti-CD16/CD32 (FcγIII/II receptors; 1:2500; BD PharMingen) for 30 minutes on ice. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCanto cytometer (Becton Dickenson) and the data were analysed with FACSDiva software. brachyury sense, CATGTACTCTTCTTGCTGG; brachyury antisense,GGTCTCGGGAAAGCAGTGGC; c-kit sense, TGTCTCTCCAGTTTCCCTGC; c-kit antisense,TTCAGGGACTCATGGGCTCA; flk1 sense, CACCTGGCACTCTCCACCTTC; flk1 antisense,GATTTCATCCCACTACCGAAAG; scl sense, ATTGCACACACGGGATTCTG; scl antisense,GAATTCAGGGTCTTCCTTAG; gata1 sense, ACTCGTCATACCACTAAG; gata1 antisense,AGTGTCTGTAGGCCTCAG; β-major sense, CGATGAAGTTGGTGGTGAGG; β-major antisense,CACAATCACGATCATATTGCC; β-H1 sense, AGTCCCCATGGAGTCAAAGA; β-H1 antisense,CTCAAGGAGACCTTTGCTCA; gapdh sense, TGGAGCCAAACGGGTCATC; gapdh antisense,GCTCTGGGATGACCTTGCC; β-actin sense, TAGGCACCAGGGTGTGATGG; β-actin antisense, CATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAGG.Quantitative PCR was performed using a two-step RT-PCR method and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science, East Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the above primers. Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl, comprising 0.5 μM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 μl SYBR Green, and 2 μl of appropriately diluted cDNA (prepared as described above). Subsequent amplification and online monitoring was performed using the LightCycler™ system (Roche Applied Science). In contrast, when we performed similar experiments with day 6 PDK1-deficient EB-derived cells, only very small erythroid colonies formed (Fig. Importantly, a Flk-1+/c-kit+ double-positive population was observed on day 4 which increased over the next 48 hours. Expression of Brachyury was reduced in day 3 EBs formed in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. Culturing EBs with 5 μM LY294002 had little or no affect on the number of blast colonies formed (Fig.
