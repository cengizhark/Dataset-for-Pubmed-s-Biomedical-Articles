Ubc9 was cloned into pcDNA3.1-myc-His-A. Ubc9 and catalytic fragments of SENP1 and SENP2 were cloned into pGEX4T3. Clarified lysates were diluted 10-fold with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor cocktail, then anti-PTEN antibody was added and the mixture was allowed to rotate for 4 hours at 4 °C. Treatments were initiated when the mean tumor volume in each randomized group (n = 8–10) reached 150 to 200 mm3. The PTEN K254R mutant retained the ability to counter PI3K signaling as its expression in PTEN-deficient human U87MG glioblastoma cells (6) resulted in comparable decreases in phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) (also called Akt) and of the PKB target GSK3β, as did expression of wt PTEN (Fig. However, by 24 hours, 53BP1 foci had largely resolved in wt PTEN- and G129E-reconstituted cells, but not in PTEN-deficient cells, cells lacking nuclear PTEN (K254R) or cells lacking all PTEN phosphatase activity (C124S) (Fig. Other forms of genotoxic stress, such as treatment with Cisplatin or Doxorubicin, also led to depletion of SUMO-PTEN, with the timing consistent with appearance of DNA damage elicited by these agents (Fig. By contrast, our results suggest that administering genotoxic agents alone to such tumors could accelerate the acquisition of additional mutations (Fig S16).
