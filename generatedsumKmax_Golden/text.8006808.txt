However, the roles of ADAMTS18 on CNS development and functions remain unclear. MWM consists of a circular pool that is filled half-way with water. Kolmogorov–Smirnov’s test was used for the Sholl analysis of dendritic complexity. The role of the laminin-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt/glycogen synthasekinase-3β (GSK-3β)/collapsin response mediator protein-2 (PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β/CRMP2) signaling pathway in the regulation of neuron polarization was then investigated (Inagaki et al , 2001; Yoshimura et al , 2005). ADAMTS-1, 4, 5, and 9) have been reported to be involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Lemarchant et al , 2013; Gottschall and Howell, 2015), the possibility that Adamts18 deletion affects the expression of other ADAMTS family members was determined. Many studies have shown that the increase in activated CRMP2 induces multiple neurite formations (Inagaki et al , 2001; Yoshimura et al , 2005). It has been shown that Lama5 mRNA is highly abundant in the hippocampal DG (Omar et al , 2017) and is largely overlapped with Adamts18. Ogino et al  (2017) reported that ADAMTS3 inactivates Reelin in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by cleaving it at Reelin repeat 3 (N-t site). Changes in dendritic structure have been observed in multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression (Qiao et al , 2016). ADAMTS18 was previously linked to white matter integrity in healthy 72- to 74-year-old people by a genome-wide association study (Lopez et al , 2012). The functions of ADAMTSs in the central nervous system (CNS) remain unclear. Images were processed by being converted to gray scale after background subtraction in Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (IPP, MediaCybernetics, Inc., SilverSpring, MD, USA) software. Then mean fluorescence intensity was gained by dividing the sum area by the sum IOD. Specific segments of spines on DG granule cells were reconstructed the same way as the analysis of dendritic morphology. The apparatus has a circular platform (diameter 46 cm), which is elevated 46 cm above the floor. The apparatus consists of a transparent acrylic box (60 × 40 cm) that is divided equally into three chambers (20 × 40 cm each).
