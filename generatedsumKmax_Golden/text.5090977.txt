Likely in both animal and human studies what is most effective in stroke may not be so in TBI. However, we have recently reported that translation of effective treatments used in animal models of stroke may not be as effective in animal models of TBI. Given the possibility that CCI resulted in an environment less supportive of experience dependent plasticity, we investigated whether behavioral treatments shown to be effective in stroke models would be as effective following CCI. While the full explanation for these findings are incomplete, these data suggest that finding viable treatments for TBI recovery may require the combination of more robust treatments to drive neural remodeling and behavioral recovery. Despite these limitations, we can still learn from stroke studies as a starting point to investigate potential effective treatments in a TBI model. We will briefly describe each technique and then describe how these neurmodulatory approaches are being tested as adjuvant treatments following stroke and TBI.
