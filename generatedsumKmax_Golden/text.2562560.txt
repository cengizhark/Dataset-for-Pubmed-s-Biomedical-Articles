Instead, we find that far more cells must be removed to prevent retinal exit: the RGCs born by 42 hpf, the critical stage (Fig. Alternately, early-born RGCs may be close enough to find the optic nerve head, while later RGCs are simply too far away to sense it. As well as showing a significant role for pioneer-follower interactions, our data suggest an even more important role for peer interactions between late retinal axons. Coronal sections through 6dpf isl2b:GFP eyes after double-staining for GFP (B, E, H) and parvalbumin (Pv;C, F, I). However, in ath5 morphants (H), central RGCs do not differentiate, although later-born RGCs in the periphery differentiate normally (arrow). (B) In ast null mutants, eight classes of errors are commonly seen, including midline crossing at the habenular and posterior commissures, and projections to the left and right telencephalon, diencephalon, ventral hindbrain (stars). In the initial frame, dorsal is up, anterior right, medial (i.e., the back of the eye) towards the viewer. The optic nerve is seen exiting the eye, and can be traced back to the RGCs. Orientation of initial frame: dorsal up, anterior left (reversed left-right from Supplementary Movie 2). Briefly, 1-cell donor embryos were injected with 5% rhodamine dextran (10,000 MW) as a lineage marker; at 4 hpf, 20–50 cells were transplanted to the animal pole of host embryos, which were raised to 5 dpf at 28.5°C. 6, donors were nontransgenic, while hosts were brn3c:GFP embryos injected with 5ng ath5MO. For cell counting, 42 hpf isl2b:gfp eyes were fixed, labeled with ToPro-3, dissected, mounted in 80% glycerol and imaged with an Olympus confocal microscope. For each chimeric larva, the presence (1 or more axons) or absence of each error was scored at 5–6 dpf by an observer blinded to genotypes, using ImageJ to examine the entire (unedited) confocal z-stack.
