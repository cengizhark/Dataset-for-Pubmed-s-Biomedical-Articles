Evaluation of ring size through the 5- and 6-membered common rings, in addition to heteroarene constructs was also performed (Scheme 2).arene and heteroarene constructs were evaluated. The original vHTS hit was divided into three zones for functional group manipulation towards understanding the impacts of various structural features of a given antagonist analogue on in vitro efficacy (Fig. A vinyl derivative lacking any aryl ring (8u), as well as direct connect aryl moieties (8l-8s) were prepared. Compounds 8m and 8o, direct-connect, aromatic derivatives of 8a and 8b, which negated the vinyl group, demonstrated lower than half biological activity compared to 1 and further validated the relevance of extension of conjugation, or electron density, as potential influences on increased activity. Based on the initial in vitro results presented, eight analogues were selected from Groups I to IV for IC50 determinations (Table 2).The IC50 values of prepared FGF-23 antagonist analogues evaluated ranged from 0.14 μM (13a) to 31 μM (6a) with a ranked order of 13a (0.14 μM), 8a (0.20 μM), 8c (0.37 μM), 14b (0.39 μM), 9b (0.52 μM), 8n (2.79 μM), 8 l (10 μM), 8o (12.3 μM) and 6a (31 μM), respectively. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data was obtained utilizing electron impact ionization (EI) with a magnetic sector (EBE trisector), double focusing-geometry mass analyzer.
