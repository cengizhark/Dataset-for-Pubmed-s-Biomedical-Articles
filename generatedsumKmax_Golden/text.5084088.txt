Cytokine concentrations were assessed in the supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cytokine measurementsCytokine measurements of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNβ and IFNγ were performed in the supernatants using commercial ELISA kits from R&D Systems, MN, USA (TNFα and IL-1β) PBL assay science, Piscataway, USA (IFNβ) or Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (IL-6 and IFNγ). The list mode data files were further analyzed using Kaluza™ software (Beckman Coulter). Cells were washed with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin before being labelled with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs. Two weeks later, mice were infected intravenously with a lethal dose of C. albicans blastoconidia (2×106 CFU/mouse). Statistical analysisDifferences were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test or Friedman test for paired samples. Otherwise stated, data are shown as cumulative results of level obtained in all volunteers (means + SEM). BCG-induced protection against disseminated Candida albicans infection is partially NK cell dependentWe have previously demonstrated that BCG vaccination protects SCID mice, which lack functional T and B cells, against systemic lethal candidiasis (1). These effects of BCG on NK-cells are biologically relevant, as we demonstrate a functional role for the trained NK cells in a murine model of lethal systemic candidiasis, in which the protection induced by BCG vaccination in SCID mice seems partially dependent on NK cells.
