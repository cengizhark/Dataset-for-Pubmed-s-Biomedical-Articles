Stimulation of Fas with Fas ligand (FasL) or TRAIL-R1/2 receptors with TRAIL induces the recruitment of FADD and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (9). Immunoblot analysis of adsorbates with anti-His showed that MUC1-CD binds to caspase-8 (Fig. To define the region of caspase-8 that interacts with MUCl-CD, we incubated GST fusion proteins of caspase-8 fragments with His-MUC1-CD. Recruitment of MUC1-C to the DISC was attenuated by silencing FADD (Fig. To define the region of FADD that confers the interaction, we incubated GST-FADD or GST-FADD deletion mutants (Fig. These binding studies confirmed the direct interaction between MUC1-CD and FADD and further demonstrated that, like caspase-8, MUC1-CD interacts with the FADD DED and not the DD (Fig. The present results demonstrate that, like cFLIPL, MUC1-C interacts directly with caspase-8-p18 (amino acids 270-322) and that this interaction is conferred by amino acids 1-20 of MUC1-CD (Fig. Caspase-8-p18 contains the catalytic Cys-360 residue that is directly inhibited by the p35 protein from baculovirus (42). MUC1-C consists of a 58 amino acid extracellular domain, a 28 amino acid transmembrane domain and a 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (25). Direct binding studies further showed that MUC1-CD(46-72) confers the interaction with FADD. For example, studies in MCF-10A cells demonstrated little constitutive interaction between MUC1-C and FADD or caspase-8. Immunoprecipitation, DISC isolation and immunoblot analysisCells were lysed by sonication in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Apoptosis assaysCells were fixed in 70% ethanol and incubated in PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase and 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were also suspended in Annexin-V-FLOUS containing propidium iodide (Roche) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
