This shRNA was highly effective at reducing expression of δ-catenin in transiently transfected tsa201 cells and in cultured rat cortical neurons, as assessed by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. EGFP-δ-catenin showed a somewhat diffuse distribution including concentration associated with dendrites and spines (supplemental Fig. Expression of EGFP-δ-catenin with vector only resulted in a pattern similar to that observed with EGFP-δ-catenin alone, whereas coexpression of shRNA 1 to erbin resulted in a more punctate pattern of expression of EGFP δ-catenin (Fig. ShRNA constructsshRNA 1 for erbin and shRNA for δ-catenin were generated in the pSuper-GFP construct. shRNA 2 for erbin was generated in the lentivirus vector (pLLX3.1). Transient transfection of tsa201 cellstsa201 cells were maintained in culture and transfected using calcium phosphate. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/sucrose, washed with PBS, and mounted in the Antifade mounting medium or were processed for immunofluorescence with the appropriate primary antibodies and fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were transfected using the Effectene (Qiagen). Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software or manually. p values obtained from this test are indicated in the figure legends. Results showed that each shRNA was highly effective in reducing erbin expression (supplemental Fig. 1E), with no significant effect on the number of primary dendrites (Fig.
