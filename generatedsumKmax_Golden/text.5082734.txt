DKK1 and sclerostin (a Wnt inhibitor) [43] may be additional biomarkers for CKD-MBD, but widespread use of bALP isoform B1x, DKK1, and sclerostin is currently limited by assay availability and reliability.Behets et al [44] characterized bone histology after treatment with cinacalcet in dialysis patients with biopsy proven high turnover bone disease, noting improvement in bone formation and biochemical markers. A number of therapeutic agents for management of bone disease now exist including anabolic (teriparatide, romosozumab) or antiresorptive (bisphosphonates, denosumab) drugs, though limited data exist on the antifracture efficacy (and sometimes safety) of these agents in CKD populations. Both of these studies were observational and small, but suggest that denosumab might be safe to use in dialysis patients with aggressive repletion of calcium and vitamin D. Finally, the sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab is an exciting new agent that improved bone mineral density via both bone formation and decreased bone resorption over 12 months in post-menopausal women, though utility in patients with CKD is unknown [48]. As past discoveries resulted in the re-branding of the field (CKD-MBD), the current multitude of inter-related factors in CKD-MBD requires novel investigative methodologies. It is assumed that reduced phosphate intake will benefit CKD and ESRD patients equally, though Selamet et al [1] found no relationship between 24-hour urine phosphate excretion (a surrogate for oral phosphate intake) and all cause mortality in pre-dialysis patients, suggesting that phosphate intake is not directly linked to serum phosphate levels as it is in dialysis patients.
