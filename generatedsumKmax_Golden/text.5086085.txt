How does the activation of the UPS system promote pruning? The PI3K-cIII complex was shown to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol lipids on endocytic membranes to give rise to PI(3)P which subsequently recruits a wide variety of proteins containing an FYVE domain. Likewise, the relationship between the endocytosis mediated dendrite thinning and dendrite severing, which is thought to be initiated by IK239 is not yet resolved. Finding the binding partner of Nrg as well as its source will provide important insights into how cell-cell interactions regulate da pruning. In the context of da neurons, epidermal cells, and not glia, have been identified to act as the primary phagocytes to clear neuronal debris.83 However, glia in the da system may still play an important role. Switching between Pruning and Regrowth must be Tightly Regulated Neuronal remodeling is an essential step in the formation of the adult nervous system. Drosophila motoneurons (MNs) also undergo extensive remodeling which takes place at different stages of development. However, the three systems that we have decided to focus on in this article are not a comprehensive list. Neuronal remodeling had also been shown in a variety of vertebrates ranging from mice to humans. Ecdysone Signaling is a Major Gatekeeper of Pruning
