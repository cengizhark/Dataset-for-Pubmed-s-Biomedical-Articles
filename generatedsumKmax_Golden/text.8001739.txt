Irrespective of the diameter (i.e., even if less than 3 mm), increase in caliber upstream to a stricture or intraductal calculus must be considered dilated. Similar to contour irregularity, loss of ductal compliance on Secretin-MRCP also implies periductal fibrosis and should be included in this category [31]. Exocrine reserveBased on the extent of fluid accumulation in duodenum and proximal jejunum with Secretin-MRCP, this can be graded as normal, mildly diminished, moderately diminished, or severely diminished [47]. Interlobular and periductal fibrosis can lead to ductal distortion, strictures, and altered ductal flow resulting in propensity for intraductal protein plugs and calculi (Fig. This can be best done by calculating the volume of pancreas or alternatively, using pancreatic thickness as a surrogate for volume (Fig. Calculating the volume is more accurate but may be impractical for adoption into daily use, particularly in a high-volume practice. 7) but also helps in identifying ductal compliance (ability of the duct to distend in response to intravenous administration of Secretin), which is a surrogate for periductal fibrosis [31]. Hence, it is not surprising that several classifications have been proposed for CP, and that most are not widely adopted or validated [3, 7-12]. Hence, assessment of pancreatic T1 signal was traditionally performed using an internal reference, such as liver, spleen, or muscle (Fig. CalcificationsPancreatic calcification burden can be graded/scored by taking into account the number of punctate and macro calcifications. However, like atrophy, grading ducts dilation is also challenging given lack of widely accepted value for normal and in view of expected age-related changes [43].
