Loss of Rac proteins, therefore, has a stronger morphological phenotype than loss of PAK1. PAK1 could also affect cell shape via regulation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Although the MAPKs are typically associated with regulation of transcription, they also affect cell migration and adhesion. After 24 hours, transmigrated cells were fixed and stained using the REASTAIN Quick-Diff kit (Reagena). An image frame was collected every 10 minutes for 8 hours using Kinetic Imaging Motion Analysis software (Andor Technology). From these movies, the number of lamellipodia was quantitated at different timepoints, and the perimeter length of individual lamellipodia was measured using Metamorph 5.01 (Universal Imaging Systems). Lamellipodial extension dynamics were analysed on kymographs generated from the time-lapse movies (Metamorph 5.0.1). The C19 antibody also showed that there was no change in PAK2 protein expression in PAK1−/− BMMs. PAK1 phosphorylation was increased by 2 minutes, and returned to basal levels by 10 minutes. 3A, Supplementary movies 3 and 4). This is consistent with the time-lapse data indicating that PAK1−/− BMM lamellipodia are less stable and collapse before they can encompass large lengths of the cell perimeter.
