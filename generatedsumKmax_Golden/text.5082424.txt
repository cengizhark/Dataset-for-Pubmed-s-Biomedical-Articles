Immigrants spent an average of 4.9 years in the United States prior to marriage. By far the largest visa category was spouse of a citizen or permanent resident, followed by employment visas (28.4 percent), legalization visas (15.8 percent), diversity visas (3.3 percent) and other visas (7 percent). Europeans, on the other hand, displayed many fewer respondents gaining permanent residence through employment visas; most (54.7 percent) entered as the spouse of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Among control variables in the model, religion and visa category are most powerfully associated with the likelihood of marrying a U.S. native. To the extent that marital assimilation is occurring among newly arrived immigrants, therefore, it does not appear to be channeled disproportionately toward native minorities nor does it depend on skin color, and in these ways do not support the propositions of segmented assimilation theory. Given the overwhelmingly Christian composition of mainstream America, this outcome is to be expected from classical theories of assimilation which posit social and cultural distance to be a deterrent to intermarriage. Of course, the subjects of our study are only just arrived in the United States and whether the structural advantages of the Asians prevail to accelerate marital assimilation in the longer run remains to be seen. According to Gordonâ€™s (1964) statement of classical assimilation theory, structural assimilation---the entry of a minority group into the mainstream labor market and the attainment of an occupational status comparable to that of the majority---would be followed inevitably by marital assimilation. In their analysis of 2000 Census data from the United States, for example, Fu and Hatfield (2008) found that native-born Asians displayed two distinct patterns of marriage. The propensity to intermarry also varies by age (Kulzycki and Lobo 2002), gender (Tubergen and Maas 2007), and religion (Alba and Golden 1986; Kalmijn 1998; Kalmijn and Tubergen 2010), as well as by contextual factors such as group size ((Blau, Blum and Schwartz 1982; Tubergen and Maas 2007; Lieberson and Waters 1988; Safi 2008; Kalmijn 1998; Hwang et al  1994; Kalmijn and Tubergen 2010; Fu and Hatfield 2008) and degree of spatial segregation (Muttarak and Heath 2010; Tubergen and Maas 2007; Kalmijn and Tubergen 2010).
