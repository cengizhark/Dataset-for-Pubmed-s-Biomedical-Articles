Dynal protein-G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were pre-washed with 5mg/ml BSA in PBS for a total of 5 times and resuspended in 100 ul of wash buffer. Extraction of methylation calls was done with Bismark methylation extractor discarding first 10 bp of both reads and reading methylation calls of overlapping parts of the paired reads from the first read (â€“no_overlap parameter). ATAC-seq alignment and peak calling statistics are summarized in table S4. The difference logo between HT-SELEX motif and the conservation pattern was made by subtracting the corresponding base frequencies.Motif similarity was calculated using SSTAT (42) with a stringent type I error threshold 0.01 to limit the effect of low affinity sites (other parameters 50% GC-content background model, pseudocount regularization). HOXB13-MethDNA complex was crystallized from the solution containing 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 24% (w/v) PEG(3350) and 8% of methyl propanol. To determine the effect of methylation of individual CpGs on TF binding, we calculated the percentage of increase of mCpG at specific positions within motifs during the bisulfite-SELEX experiment (see the methods).
