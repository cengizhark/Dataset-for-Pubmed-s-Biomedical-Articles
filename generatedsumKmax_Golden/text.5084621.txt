Three out of 25 subjects were excluded due to the difficulty in localization of the nerve caused by low SNR attributing to either motion or extremely small size and individual variations in the shape and location of the sural nerve.Table 2 lists diffusion values obtained from 22 normal subjects who have been scanned using 6, 15, and 32 gradient directions. Considering that those reported values were obtained with measurements from less number of gradient directions (Nd=6,15), the higher limit in our FA values at 6 and 15 directions (Table 2) were 0.768 (0.659+0.109) and 0.689 (0.615+0.074), respectively, making the measurements of the sural nerve using less Nd in closer agreement, though in lower limit, with the previously reported values of the tibial nerve. One limiting factor in our protocol described is a relatively long data acquisition time, which spans to 20 min for acquiring 32-directional DTI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) technique that can be used for gaining quantitative information about tissue water diffusion. The EPI image acquired without diffusion weighting (b=0) was used for determining registration parameters for mapping diffusion data to anatomical volumes and the same transformation was used to map the FA values computed from DTI data acquired with 32, 15, and 6 gradient directions.
