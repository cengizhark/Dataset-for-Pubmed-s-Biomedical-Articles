However, to date, the lack of large publicly available clinical imaging cohorts with follow-up data has been an impediment the development and validation of CNN-based models. Study cohortsThis multi-institutional study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution, and conducted in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), with all patient records deidentified before analysis. The subjects in Cohort 1 were selected from a pool of NSCLC patients referred for surgical treatment between 2008 and 2012 with diagnostic CT performed prior to surgical procedures. Cohort 3 comprised patients with confirmed primary tumors who received surgery. The CNN architecture incorporates three 3D convolutional layers with size 16×3×3 along with a 3D max-pooling layer with kernel size = 2, stride = 2. ROC were generated using classification probabilities of malignant labels versus benign labels of total number of testing images with Python scikit-learn library (v 0.19.1). ROC curves were compared statistically according to Hanley and McNeil method31. Data AvailabilityCohort 1 (Stanford Hospital, n=129): The data is publicly available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) at: http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2017.7hs46erv63Cohort 2 (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, n=185): A portion of the data (54/185) is available from TCIA at: Code AvailabilityCode for the LungNet is available at https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.0612256.v168. In the first phase, with round robin training and evaluation, LungNet achieved validation CI of 0.62 on cohorts 1, 2 and 3. The groups showed significant separation in terms of Kaplan-Meier curves for all three cohorts, with two-sided log-rank P values: 2.59e-03, 7.82e-05, 1.10e-05 on cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The clinical features only model, by comparison, achieved much poorer stratification, with log-rank P values: 7.92e-03, 9.98e-03, and 6.90e-01 on cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 3D variants of these networks require even more data, and even large datasets such as UCF-101 (>13,000 action instances), HMDB-51 (>7,500 videos) and ActivityNet (>28,000 action instances) may not be sufficient to train them from scratch 39, These are typically not available for most biomedical applications. Of course, the predicted hazard ratios can be used to stratify patients into high and low risk groups and the corresponding KM curves showed significant separation for every cohort. For example, treatment may be intensified for high risk patients with higher radiation doses or additional cycles of chemotherapy, while de-intensifying treatment for low risk patients.
