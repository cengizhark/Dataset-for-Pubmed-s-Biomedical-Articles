Utilization is here operationalized as the percent of possible network-network edges included in the full set of features that were selected on every iteration. Several possibilities include differences in participant setting during behavioral testing (in scanner or out of scanner), differences in reliability among behavioral tests used, and differences in the distribution of behavior or age ranges of HCP and SMC subjects, as individual differences in memory are thought to be magnified in aging (Nagel et al , 2008). To do so, we first followed the procedures of Finn et al , 2015 to group our 268 nodes into ten anatomically defined brain regions and eight functionally defined canonical networks. This overlap was determined to be significant (P = 1.4*10−232) using the hypergeometric cumulative distribution function (Rosenberg et al , 2018). In the present study, we provide a novel demonstration that distributed patterns of functional connectivity are a broadly applicable predictor of individual differences in WM. Scan parameter details can be found in Ugurbil et al  (2013). Between March 2008 and February 2009, fMRI data and neuropsychological assessments (Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery) were collected from 278 individuals classified into three levels of memory function: Alzheimer’s disease patients (AD; n=112), amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI; n=87), and healthy controls (n=79). Full information regarding patients’ medical histories and diagnostic criteria as well as neuropsychological assessment and fMRI scan procedures are detailed in Ahn et al  (2010) and Kim et al  (2015). Of the 278 patients, aged 44-90 years, we identified the 157 (mean age 68.7 ± 9.6 years; 105 females; 55 AD, 54 aMCI, 48 healthy) who completed all neuropsychological assessments and fMRI runs with average frame-to-frame motion <0.2mm, maximum translation <2mm, and maximum rotational motion <3°. Functional connectivity matrices were created by calculating the Pearson correlation between each of 268 nodes of the whole brain (Shen et al , 2013 whole-brain gray matter atlas). External validation in an independent, older age sample with memory impairmentTo test whether WM CPMs defined in the HCP dataset were robust to participant population, scan site and parameters, and memory measure, we applied them to resting-state functional connectivity matrices from the SMC sample.
