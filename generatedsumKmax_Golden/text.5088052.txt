Viral media was concentrated by precipitation with 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) with 500 mM sodium chloride47, resuspended in Tris-MgCl2, and then added to the lysates. Seven to eight days post-injection, mice were euthanized and the brain and spinal cord were collected. IHC was performed on floating sections with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS containing 10% goat or donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 (no detergent was used for GAD67 staining). Primary antibodies incubations were performed for 16-24 hrs at RT. Tissue clearingMice were perfused as above with 60-80 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA in PB at a flow rate of 14 mL per minute. The mice were then placed in individual custom-built chambers24 and perfused with 200 mL of recycling RT 4% acrylamide in PB at 2-3 mL/min overnight followed by a 2-hr perfusion flush with PB to remove residual polymers/monomers from the vasculature. From day 43 onwards, cortical spheroids were maintained in NPC medium, which was changed every 4 days. After the second selection, several variants were enriched (Supplementary Table 2) and showed enhanced CNS transduction (Supplementary Fig. Using PARS-based CLARITY for whole body tissue clearing24, we imaged native eGFP fluorescence through cleared sections of tissue from the spinal cord (Fig. AAV-PHP.B provided significantly greater gene transfer than AAV9 to each of the CNS regions examined: cortex (40-fold), striatum (92-fold), thalamus (76-fold), cerebellum (41-fold) and spinal cord (75-fold). Therefore, although the tropism of AAV-PHP.B is not CNS specific, the enhanced gene transfer characteristics of this vector are CNS specific. 4a-d), as well as reduced tropism for the liver (Fig.
