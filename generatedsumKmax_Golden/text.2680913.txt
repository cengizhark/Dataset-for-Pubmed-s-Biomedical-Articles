3A responded to paired pulse inputs with depression (blue points in Fig. 4C), the data for uEPSC peak amplitude vs. latency is best fit by a logarithmic decay function (y = −0.32 * log(x) + 0.982; p < 0.01). The three different models were statistically compared (see Materials and Methods) in order to find out which most adequately explains the data with the minimal assumptions. The quantal model allows extraction of quantal size (in pA) that corresponds to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter; this model was chosen for 30 of 75 cases (40%). 6H) suggesting that the binomial release probability and the overall release probability should correlate, as is the case (R2 = 0.59; p <0.01 Fig. This is in contrast with previous estimates of release probabilities at individual L4-L4 sites (rat S1, average Pr=79±2% – Silver et al , 2003; cat V1 range of Pr=68−98% - Tarczy-Hornoch et al , 1999). It is unlikely that late development of spiny stellates was a factor because we used guinea pigs (which are more precocious than other rodents - Rice et al , 1985) in their second postnatal week, when spiny stellates are abundant within L4 in other preparations such as rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al , 1999; Schubert et al , 2003; Feldmeyer et al , 2005). All the putative anatomical synaptic contacts that we observed were located on proximal basilar dendrites (distance range = 33−151 μm from the soma; n=9 connected pairs). Such putative contacts are often anatomically verifiable synapses (93% - Silver et al , 2003; 86% - Lubke et al , 2003) although other studies suggest the proportion may be much smaller (32%; DaCosta and Martin, 2007). Excitatory L4 neurons in guinea pig V1 have ∼2500 spines (see Results). Cells with membrane potentials more positive than −60 mV and recordings with high access resistance (>40 MΩ or >20% the value of the input resistance for that cell) were discarded. We chose to record the unitary synaptic currents under voltage clamp (vs. recording synaptic potentials under current clamp) for better signal to noise and detection of small events for quantal analysis. Intracortical information processing has serial and parallel components (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Gilbert, 1983, 1993; Callaway, 1998; Martin, 2002; Thomson and Bannister, 2003), through vertical interlaminar and horizontal intralaminar projections (Lund et al , 1979; Ahmed et al , 1994; Lubke et al , 2000). A full account of the analysis methods used in this study has been described in others’ studies (Stricker and Redman, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004). Once this optimal K was obtained, a quantal model (in which the peaks are forced to be equally distanced by a separation q, corresponding to the quantal content of a synaptic vesicle) was fit to the uEPSC PDF and compared to the unconstrained model.
