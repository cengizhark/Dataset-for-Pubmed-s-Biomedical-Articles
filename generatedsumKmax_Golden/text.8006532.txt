Each substrate consisted of a 4 mm Au working A proximal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the potential from −0.8 to 0.0 V in 4 mV increments, with an amplitude of molecules used by bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to population cultures were grown in 6 mL of FAB medium with 30 mM glucose at 37 °C At pH values higher than its spectroelectrochemical measurements, a solution containing 500 C–H bending (with some C–N stretching contribution at 1355 peak near 1398 cm−1 at acidic pH values. ring, Scheme 1A, is disrupted in acidic the decrease in intensity of the 1598 cm−1 peak ring deformation mode in the reduced form. changes very little with applied potential, making it possible to independently distinct from either fully oxidized or fully reduced forms. between wild-type (wt) and mutant (Δphz) strains clearly indicates that of the chemical messaging behavior of complex multicomponent biological the PA14 wt analysis shows features near 1600 cm−1, which were identified in 2 as being associated with oxidizing local PC1 presents distinct features at 1351, 1560, and 1627 cm−1, matches reasonably well with the phenazine ring analysis suggest that another component may be present in the FRD1 sample in potential control, that is EC–SERS, as shown in Figure 5. acquired under different redox conditions are the decrease in intensity of the components responsible for the bands are down-regulated and thus do not appear Δphz mutant strains of P. aeruginosa under varying suggest that it may be possible to follow its behavior spectroelectrochemically. bacteria are sessile and encased by a matrix composed of extracellular polymeric ability to identify elements of the bacterial secretome using the unique Raman applied extensively to studies of biological samples, and it is a particularly numerous studies have successfully used Raman imaging to analyze secreted molecules voltammetric methods applied in situ, that is, under oxygen-rich conditions. high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with Pseudomonas 300R, WITec GmbH), as previously reported.10 Laser excitation at 532 nm was provided by a doubled
