Owing to lack of specificity with some ICD-9-CM procedure codes, we optimized case capture by using ICD-9-CM codes for tendon and muscle repairs, as well as reattachment of fingers and thumb. Our procedure and diagnosis code list was reviewed and verified for completeness by our University billing and coding specialists. Some hand surgeons do not provide replantation care owing to limitations in their practice model or case volume and experience.8 Many others do not provide this care because of financial and hospital system constraints.8, 9 Although regionalization of replantation care has been proposed as an approach to combat some of these limitations in provider access4, 10, issues of inadequate compensation – often caused by a lack of insurance coverage in the finger amputation patient population – must also be addressed. the slope, to follow the change over time, and also calculated the absolute effect of the expansion at the end of the study period.21Lastly, based on NY demographic data 22 we also calculated population-adjusted numbers of patients treated in each quarter across the study period to evaluate the absolute number of Medicaid and uninsured patients who received the replantation surgeries. Medicaid beneficiaries comprised a significantly greater proportion of the patients receiving replantation procedures after expansion of Medicaid coverage in NY in 2001. Considering that replantation care is more often provided at tertiary referral centers and academic centers, the financial burden of the uninsured is disproportionately placed on these institutions.4, 11 This is especially true of emergent hand surgery transfers, as patients without insurance or on Medicaid are transferred significantly more frequently to urban academic centers than those with private insurance coverage.35 Although Medicaid reimbursement is often lower than that of private payers, when compared to the financial challenges of caring for the uninsured with complex hand trauma, the profit margin benefit of Medicaid coverage to the hand surgeon and the institution is substantial.36 We also cannot determine whether the change in trend of uninsured care was due to direct transition of these patients on to Medicaid or if these were separate groups of patients, although this would not detract from the overall benefit of increased care delivery to the medically underserved.
