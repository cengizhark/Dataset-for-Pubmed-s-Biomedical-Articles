In this chapter, we will describe the methods to determine gene expression by using RT-PCR and real-time PCR. 1) and analyzed by Quantity One.To semi-quantify the expression level of mRNA, intensities of target gene products are normalized to that of housekeeping gene to obtain the relative densities. The study of gene expression in a cell or tissue at a particular moment gives an insight into the capacity of the cell for protein synthesis.

Although it is convenient, time-saving, and avoids contact with phenol/chloroform using commercially available kits, those kits using silica-membrane spin columns may not be ideal for studies of insoluble nanoparticle since the nanoparticles may clog the membrane pore of the spin column. Although there are many kits commercially available for RT, the reverse transcriptase used in those kits usually is M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus or AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus. Since M-MLV reverse transcriptase is less processive than AMV reverse transcriptase, therefore, more units of the M-MLV enzyme are required to generate the same amount of cDNA as in the AMV reaction (2).
