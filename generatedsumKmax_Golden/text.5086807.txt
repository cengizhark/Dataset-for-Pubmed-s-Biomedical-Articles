Since Nono is reported to bind mRNAs and required for mRNA processing in differentiation cells (Clemson et al , 2009; Fox et al , 2002; Fox and Lamond, 2010; Hutchinson et al , 2007; Li et al , 2009; Sunwoo et al , 2009), it is conceivable that such a mechanism may be critical for Nono-bound bivalent genes to produce mature mRNAs once mESCs leave the primed state to differentiate. It will also be of importance to evaluate whether this mechanism is conserved in the regulation of ESCs of human and other species.In summary, our findings highlight a function for Nono in mESCs where it plays a critical role at the chromatin interface to regulate Erk signaling, impacting the integrity of bivalent chromatin at developmental genes and mESC pluripotency. Nono loss compromises mESC differentiationWe next investigated whether Nono null cells also exhibit compromised ability to undergo differentiation as a result of an impaired Erk activity and compromised activation of Nono/Erk co-bound bivalent genes.
