LG-CC is an evidence-based CCM (9) that included four weekly self-management sessions focused on managing depressive and bipolar symptoms that occurred during the first month, and ongoing telephone-based care management contacts occurring up to 6 months after patient enrollment that were implemented by clinical social workers at each site. Providers from participating clinics received an LG-CC toolkit and training, but were randomized at the clinic level to receive either additional coaching via proactive, regular contacts to address barriers to LG-CC uptake (10) or as-needed technical support. Of the 385 study participants with complete baseline surveys, 139 did not complete the 12-month survey. Of those who completed both surveys, 27 had either missing outcome or covariate data. CCMs are typically implemented by a clinical nurse or social worker (care manager) who provides individual self-management support, coordinates care between providers (care management), completes outcomes assessments, and links patients to specialists in collaboration with the individualâ€™s physician. Because homelessness history was associated with missingness, it is possible that those with a history of homelessness who needed to be seen in the emergency department were more likely to have participated in the 12-month survey than those with a history of homelessness who did not need ED visits. These individuals may have unmet service needs that require additional management beyond standard care management. Future studies may also require the further intensification of evidence-based Collaborative Care Models for individuals with serious mental illness in order to potentially mitigate critical service encounters and improve outcomes.
