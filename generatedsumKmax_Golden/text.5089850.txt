As part of this function, XBP1 may also contribute to the previously described rapid induction of sugarbabe by dietary sugars (Mattila et al , 2015; Zinke et al , 2002). A UPR-independent function for both IRE1 and XBP1 has previously been proposed in the context of development (Shen et al , 2005). Our data suggest that such deleterious effects of IRE1 deficiency on epithelial homeostasis are preceded by changes in the homeostatic metabolism of ECs. Details in Sup Materials.Starvation AssaysFlies were maintained as for a longevity survival assay. In situ HybridizationProtocol was adapted from (Zinke et al , 2002) using Digoxigenin (DIG) labeled RNA probes detected by NBT/BCIP assay (DIG nucleic acid detection kit, Roche). Dietary Restriction (DR), defined as a regime of limited protein intake without malnutrition, leads to increased lifespan and healthspan in all tested model organisms (Fontana and Partridge, 2015; Kapahi et al , 2010). We confirmed efficient IRE1 down-regulation in dissected guts by qPCR using two EC drivers 5966GS-GAL4 and NP1-GAL4 (Fig S1G, H). To assess these possibilities we examined the dynamic changes in TGs after feeding radiolabeled glucose for a 36h period as described previously (Katewa et al , 2012). Its expression is strongly repressed in melt mutants, which have almost 50% less fat stores than normal (Teleman et al , 2005).
