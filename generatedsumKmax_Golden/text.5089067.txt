cRSS-mediated deletions and candidate driver mutationsCryptic RSS junctions affected genes with a potential oncogenic impact in that they govern cell proliferation, differentiation or survival. Almost 90% of cRSS junctions in the collection interrupted a gene and well over half of these genes (65%) were associated with cancer (for additional details see Supplemental Experimental procedures and Table S4). This is the translocation between chr4 and chr14 creating a signal joint composed of the RSS of a TCR VÎ±-gene segment (chr14) and a cryptic RSS within Kdm1a locus (chr4; Fig. Whereas there is little question that Notch1, Jak1, Ikzf1, Fhit, and Pten, all included in the short, expertly curated list of 572 COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/), are drivers in the oncogenic process, the four remaining recurrently mutated genes occupy a gray zone.To address this, we developed a system for stratifying all the genes mutated in the present study according cancer relevance (Experimental Procedures and Table S4). Agpat9 (Table S4B) and Trat1 however have modest or no support for a cancer role in the literature (see Table S4C). When each is plotted according to their two distance-to-breakpoint values, authentic V(D)J junctions fell into a tight cluster averaging 3 nucleotides from either CAC motif. The presence of two populations in our experimental data was confirmed by analyzing a set of 180 simulated junctions (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), which reconstructed only the broadly scattered distribution (Fig.
