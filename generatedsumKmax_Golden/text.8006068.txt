The second critical gap within the literature concerns the type of staff member included as a study participant. Similarly concerning is the lack of diversity within the behavioral health workforce. Although more recent numbers for specific job types are not available, there is some evidence that the demographics of licensed psychologists have changed recently. Although PCIT was originally developed to target externalizing behavior problems, it has been adapted to treat a variety of child mental health concerns. If a member of the research team learned of a staff member leaving the clinic at any point outside of the assessment windows, the team member followed up with the participant to complete the Agency Staff Change Form (described below). Given the problems associated with high rates of turnover, it has been the subject of a substantial body of literature, which has evolved in various ways over the past few decades. As previously mentioned, study team members also completed the form if they learned about a staff member leaving the original clinic at any point during the study outside of assessment windows.
