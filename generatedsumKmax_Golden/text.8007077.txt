Importantly, this study provides validated statistical models to estimate FMI and FFMI from inexpensive, routine and easily attainable measures of BMI, age, sex and ambulatory status to provide a more accurate assessment of body composition in children with CP. To limit motion during the scan, children with CP were secured from the waist down using the BodyFIX (Medical Intelligence Inc, Schwabmunchen,Germany) and a modified procedure, as previously described.21 The modified BodyFIX procedure has no effect on body composition estimates from DXA in children.20After completion of the scan, total body (excluding the head) FMI and FFMI were determined by dividing tissue mass (kg) by height (m) squared as follows: Height, height percentile, BMI, FMI and FFMI were determined using standing height for ambulatory children with CP and controls and height estimated from knee height (and forearm length) in nonambulatory children with CP. Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted if the variances were equal or Games-Howell post hoc tests if the variances were unequal. When children with CP were separated based on ambulatory status, compared to controls, nonambulatory children with CP had lower height percentile (d = 1.484, p < 0.001) and body mass percentile (d = 0.991, p = 0.011). Compared to controls, the total sample of children with CP had higher %Fat (d = 0.838, p < 0.001) and FMI (d = 0.650, p = 0.033), lower fat-free mass (d = 0.729, p = 0.001) and FFMI (d = 0.639, p = 0.005), but no difference in fat mass (d = 0.387, p = 0.102). Ambulatory children with CP alsohad lower fat-free mass (d = 0.620, p = 0.045) than controls, though there were no group differences in FMI or FFMI (both d < 0.51, p > 0.05).There were no differences in any body composition measure between nonambulatory and ambulatory children with CP(all d < 0.55, p > 0.05). However, when BMI was statisticallycontrolled, nonambulatory children with CP compared to ambulatory children with CP and controls had higher %Fat (p = 0.030 and p < 0.001, respectively), fat mass (p =0.037 and p = 0.002, respectively) and FMI (p = 0.032 and p #x003C; 0.001, respectively), and lower FFMI (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively). The prediction of FMI (R2 = 0.86) and FFMI (R2 = 0.66) from BMI significantly increased (both R2 change, p < 0.05) when age, sex and ambulatory status were included in the regression model, as shown in Table 3 where height was estimated from knee height in nonambulatory children with CP for the calculation of BMI, FMI and FFMI (models 1 and 2, respectively). All interaction terms between independent variables did not significantly contribute and were therefore not included in the model. Instead, children with CP had lower fat-free mass, which is consistent with a previous study.7 When body tissues were expressed relative to height using FMI and FFMI, children with CP had a higher proportion of fat and a lower proportion of fat-free tissue than typically developing children. Moreover, the independent predictors in the model are measures that are easily attainable during routine clinical visits or visits pertaining to research study participation. Lastly, body composition was assessed using the same DXA scanner and software.
