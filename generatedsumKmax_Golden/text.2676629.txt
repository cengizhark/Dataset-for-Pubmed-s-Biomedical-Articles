Two-way ANOVA (with repeated measures) indicated a significant effect of SNR level (F[1,12]=72.1, p<0.0005), a significant effect of stimulus processing (F[2,24]=538.1, p<0.0005) and a significant interaction (F[2,24]=7.9, p=0.002).Post-hoc tests (Scheffe) applied to the sentence scores at -5 dB SNR revealed highly significant differences (p<0.0005) between the scores obtained in the OFF and NSY (control) conditions, and between the NSY and CLN conditions. This can be attributed to the subjects making use of the vowel formant transitions into and out of the medial consonant. Figure 3 (bottom panel) shows an example spectrogram of a sentence processed using FC = 1000 Hz at -5 dB SNR.C. Two-way ANOVA (with repeated measures) applied to the sentence scores indicated a significant effect of SNR level (F[1,12]=1094.9, p<0.0005), a significant effect of frequency FC (F[5,60]=80.1, p<0.0005) and a significant interaction (F[5,60]=13.5, p<0.0005). Two-way ANOVA (with repeated measures) applied to the VCV scores indicated a significant effect of SNR level (F[1,12]=72.8, p<0.0005), a significant effect of frequency FC (F[5,60]=33.4, p<0.0005) and a significant interaction (F[5,60]=5.8, p<0.0005). Two-way ANOVA (with repeated measures) applied to the voicing scores indicated a significant effect of SNR level (F[1,12]=62.4, p<0.0005), a significant effect of frequency FC (F[5,60]=11.8, p<0.0005) and non-significant interaction (F[5,60]=1.1, p=0.36). Similar ANOVA applied to the manner and place feature scores revealed significant effects for SNR level and frequency FC and non-significant interactions.As shown in Figure 5 (top panel), large improvements were noted in the transmission of voicing information when FC ≥ 500 Hz. Significant (p<0.05) improvements to transmission of manner feature were noted for FC ≥ 3000 Hz at -5 dB SNR and for FC =12.5 kHz (CLN) at 0 dB SNR. Segments with non-zero F0 values were initially classified as voiced and segments with zero F0 value (as determined by the STRAIGHT algorithm) were classified as unvoiced.
