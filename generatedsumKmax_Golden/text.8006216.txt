In the normal brain, the ECM contains high levels of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) hyaluronan, and proteoglycans (PGs), and low levels of fibrous proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and laminin (Ruoslahti, 1996; Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008). Investigation of gene expression of tumor cells in hydrogelsThe expression of uPA and MMP9 of U87 and A172 glioma cells in non-crosslinked collagen hydrogel was significantly higher than that of cells on the culture dish or in crosslinked collagen hydrogel (p < 0.01). Fibrous proteins are the major components of basement membranes of the brain’s vasculature system (Berczi and Szentiványi, 2009). The generated microtumors using the ECM are a valued model for studying the role of 3D cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. An in vivo study showed that treatment of tranexamic acid to male C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of ischemia-reperfusion-elicited intravascular firm adherence and transmigration of neutrophils (Reichel et al , 2011). Collagen, a type of natural biomaterial, is one component of the glioblastoma ECM. Collagen, a type of natural biomaterial, is one component of the glioblastoma ECM. The gene expression level of these molecules varies in response to different extracellular microenvironments (Egeblad et al , 2010; Kessenbrock et al , 2010). A number of signaling pathways facilitate the invasion of a glioblastoma. Previous studies showed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 regulate cellular proliferation, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis of glioblastomas (Lei et al , 2015; Musumeci et al , 2015; Rao, 2003; Song et al , 2009; Tabouret et al , 2013). The cDNA was generated using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY). Power SYBR® Master Mix was used to perform the qRT-PCR using the Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The size of these microtumors decreased significantly after they were cultured for 3 days. The reduction value increased to 43.5 ± 0.9% and 42.8 ± 0.4% (p < 0.01), respectively, after culturing for 7 days.
