IPSCs elicited by CPPG (ON) or kainate (OFF) stimulation were reduced to similar extents by CPP (10 μm) and abolished by the additional application of GYKI (25 μM; Figure 5E–G). Similar results were observed in mouse (ω-conotoxin GVIA and isradipine reduced IPSCs to 44 ± 10% of control, n = 5, p = 0.0002). Conversely, in the presence of the NMDAR antagonist CPP (10 μm), RR reduced IPSCs significantly (to 70 ± 15% of CPP alone, n = 6, p = 0.002; Figure 7D, H) but 2-APB did not (93 ± 7% of CPP alone, n = 6, p = 0.08; Figure 7F, H). Under these conditions, IPSCs were reduced by the group I mGluR antagonist LY367385 (50 μM; Figure 8A, E). Neither the Group II mGluR antagonist LY341495 (5 μM; Figure 8C, E) nor the Group III antagonist MSOP (100 μM; Figure 8 D, E) reduced IPSCs significantly. LY367385 (50 μm) exerted insignificant effects on IPSCs evoked by puffs of CPPG (97 ± 5% of control, n = 4, p = 0.31; Supplementary Figure 3A, D) or kainate (92 ± 9% of control, n = 4, p = 0.18; Supplementary Figure 3B, D). CICR is observed in many neuronal types and usually is mediated by IP3Rs and/or RyRs (Berridge, 1998). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Axoclamp-1D, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) were made while continuously superfusing the slice with ASCF in a rate of 1–2 ml/min. In some experiments (Figure 5), CPPG (600 μM, 300 ms, 1.5 bar) or kainate (100 μM, 300 ms, 1.5 bar) was puffed in the OPL (80–100 μm laterally from the recorded RBC) to activate ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. In these experiments, control ACSF also contained the group III mGluR agonist L-AP4 (10 μM). At the end of each series, the pipette was returned to the 0-μm position and three final responses were averaged and compared to the 0-μm responses obtained at the beginning of the experiment. Peak response amplitudes at each position were normalized to that recorded at the initial 0 μm position in control solution. The spatial extent of the puff itself (Supplementary Figure 1) was quantified in the same way to facilitate comparison with the glutamate-evoked IPSC data. IPSCs were partially reduced by bath application of SR95531 (10 μM) and TPMPA (50 μM), GABAA and GABAC receptor antagonists, respectively(to 33 ± 10 % of control; n = 4; p = 0.006; Fig 1C, D). Furthermore, the reduction of the IPSC by TTX remained incomplete even in the presence of DHT (Figure 2C, D). Glutamate-evoked IPSCs were reduced by application of the non-NMDAR antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX, 25 μM; Figure 4A, E) or the NMDAR antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 μM; Fig 4B, E). Glutamate-evoked IPSCs also were reduced by the AMPAR-specific antagonist GYKI 53655 (50 μM; Figure 4C, E) but were only slightly affected by the Ca2+-permeable AMPAR antagonist philanthotoxin 433 (PhTx; 1 μM; Fig.
