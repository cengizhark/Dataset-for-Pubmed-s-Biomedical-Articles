Evolution-Guided Drug Design Could Inform Principled Decisions between Mutational Vulnerabilities during Drug DevelopmentTo further investigate how an evolutionarily informed approach to drug design might affect the clinical prevalence of resistance, we conceived of a hypothetical BCR-ABL TKI, which we call maxitinib, designed with mutational liabilities in mind. To be clear, it is inaccurate to say that drug selection is unimportant. Structure-based drug design is the industry standard to create potent second-generation inhibitors and has succeeded in ABL1+ leukemias (O’Hare et al , 2009; Wylie et al , 2017), c-KIT/PDGFR-mutated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (Evans et al , 2017), ALK/EGFR+lung cancers (Butterworth et al , 2017; Zhang et al , 2016), RET mutants/fusions (Subbiah et al , 2018), and TRK fusions (Menichincheri et al , 2016). This system was simulated stochastically for a range of Mpre and Mpost values, and for each combination 50,000 virtual patients were analyzed using MATLAB. Because the less drug-resistant variant appeared in the clinic more often, we examined the relative growth rate of E255V and E255K in the absence of drug. However, the relative growth rates for E255V, E255K, and wild-type BCR-ABL cells were statistically indistinguishable (growth rate ± 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.98 ± 0.075, 1.03 ± 0.125, and 0.96 ± 0.075, respectively; Figure 1E), despite having 80% power to detect a 10% growth rate difference. We posit that an important step forward involves using decades of improvements in evolutionary theory (Coldman and Goldie, 1983, 1986; Goldie and Coldman, 1979, 1984; Iwasa et al , 2006; Komarova, 2006; Lässig et al , 2017; Lind et al , 2019; Lobkovsky and Koonin, 2012; Lukačišinová and Bollenbach, 2017; Łuksza and Lässig, 2014) and population genetics (Gerrish and Lenski, 1998; LeClerc et al , 1996; Stoltzfus and McCandlish, 2017) to create additional design principles for drug discovery informed by evolution. Thus, the literature presents us with an opportunity to estimate how genetic context and experimental conditions might affect drug response. This might suggest that the genetic drift in cell lines in an individual lab can influence drug potency and is consistent with recent findings (Ben-David et al , 2018).
