Future studies will undoubtedly provide further evidence of conserved and differential mechanisms for axon and dendrite pruning in MB and ddaC neurons in Drosophila. Indeed, glial cells have been shown to engulf axonal debris [15, 16], dependent on the engulfment receptor Draper (Drpr, CED-1 homolog) [17, 18] and CED-6 [17]. Recently, two studies have highlighted astrocytes as the major phagocytic glia [19, 20] in a process that depends on Drpr [19, 20] functioning in parallel to CED-12 [19]. TGF-Î² signaling is initiated by glial secretion of Myo [21] functioning through the type I receptor Baboon (Babo) and either one of the type II receptors Punt or Wishful thinking (Wit) (Figure 3) [23]. Phagocytic hemocytes were shown to be involved engulfment and degradation of the dendritic fragments and debris [8], which involves activation of extracellular matrix metalloproteases [9]. Moreover, DIAP1 and caspases are regulated by Valosin-containing protein (VCP) [46]. To achieve this, the F-box protein Slimb, a component of the SCF E3 ligase, associates with Akt, an activator of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway, resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [28].
