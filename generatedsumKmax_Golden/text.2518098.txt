2C).In order to test whether proteasome inhibitors could increase the levels of endogenous cyclin G1 in undamaged cells, we treated a variety of cell lines with MG-132 and observed a consequent increase in cyclin G1 protein (Fig. In a similar experiment, HA antibodies were used to IP the tagged ubiquitin and blots were probed for Flag-cyclin G1 (Fig. ARF physically interacts with MDM2 and antagonizes its ability to negatively regulate p53. However, we did detect a defect in the G2/M checkpoint following Î³-irradiation in KD expressing cells. p19ARF was a gift from Karl Munger and p14ARF was kindly provided by Martine Roussel. For half-life experiments in transfected U2OS cells, a single transfected 10-cm dish was trypsinized and plated in 5 wells of a 6-well dish. Quantitation of bands was performed using ImageJ. Quantitation of bands was performed using ImageJ. Coverslips were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS and incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour at RT. Additionally, we noted a substantial increase in the steady-state level of the KD mutant, suggesting an increase in protein stability.
