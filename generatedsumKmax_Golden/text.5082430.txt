At baseline, the mother reported her daughter’s disruptive behavior in the clinical range on both the ECBI Intensity Scale (Intensity score = 221) and Problem Scale (Problem score = 33).Case 7 dropped out of the study after session three. At baseline, the mother reported that her son exhibited disruptive behavior below the clinical range on ECBI Intensity Scale (Intensity Score = 124), but above the clinical range on the Problem Scale (Problem score = 20).This family’s overall technology use was above the other TE-HNC participants (i.e., 78% compared to 65%). At baseline, the father reported that his daughter exhibited disruptive behaviors in the clinical range on both ECBI scales (Intensity Score = 133; Problem score = 23).This family’s overall technology use exceeded the use of other TE-HNC families (i.e., 75% compared to 66%). That said, the relative lack of within-group variability may suggest participants in the TE-HNC group were unique in some way (e.g., families would be high engagers regardless of technology use); however, it is important to remember that random assignment to group in the pilot RCT should have decreased the likelihood of this group being unique. Despite the aforementioned caveats, the case series design still provided a preliminary window into how variability in use of and attitudes toward technology may correspond with outcomes in technology-enhanced services.
