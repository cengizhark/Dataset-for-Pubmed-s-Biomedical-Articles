Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. However, a very recent study had a different view. This observation is associated with a reduction of phosphatidylserine externalization (104). We are currently preparing this mouse model and hopefully, in the near future, we should be able to investigate the impact of inducible PLTP deficiency in atherogenesis. We are currently preparing this mouse model and hopefully, in the near future, we should be able to investigate the impact of inducible PLTP deficiency in atherogenesis. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) belongs to a family of lipid transfer proteins (1). Many physiological factors and pathological stimuli can also regulate the expression of PLTP activity. In general, each of these transfer proteins have a boomerang shape, with the N-terminal and C-terminal barrel structures linked together to form a hydrophobic channel for the transport of lipid molecules. Many human studies agreed with our observation (37–40). In mouse models, global PLTP deficiency attenuates the development of atherosclerosis (51), whereas PLTP overexpression has an opposite effect (52–54). Human Pltp transgenic rabbits have a significant increase in plasma LDL (66) which could be related with more VLDL production. It is well known that hepatocytes, enterocytes, and peripheral tissue cells (such macrophages) make contribution to HDL formation through ABCA1 (68, 72). Since PLTP can help ABCA1 to efflux lipids (73), PLTP activity should have an impact in HDL production in these three type cells (Figure 1). We also found that liver-specific PLTP deficiency significantly decreases HDL and apoA-I levels (65). However, systemic apoM deficiency in mice can only decrease plasma S1P levels by 25-45% (93, 94).
