In this paper, we present the engineering aspects of a general methodology tailored to spatiotemporally control mechanical forces inside bioreactors. Oj denotes a measurement (observed value), whereas Tj denotes the corresponding desired measurement (target value). The search algorithm aims to find a solution that is better than the one provided by the MLP, by following a number of rules to introduce changes to the MLP output as shown in the pseudocode below (see Algorithm 1). In this study, velocity measurements represent velocities averaged along the z-direction. In this study, velocity measurements represent velocities averaged along the z-direction. 5(d) shows a uniform pattern. These results also validate the use of a simplified CFD model in the training phase, in order to reduce computational cost and training time. The algorithm demonstrates high efficiency, as it converges to a solution with a small number of iterations. Inlets are distributed around a chamber that holds a 3-mm-thick scaffold. 1(a) and (b) show the CAD drawings of the bioreactor design. NMR imaging probe. Scaffolds were held in place by two large pore-density filters. C.Adaptive Control AlgorithmMachine learning methods including artificial neural networks are now commonly used to solve a variety of problems in cell biology [22], [23].
