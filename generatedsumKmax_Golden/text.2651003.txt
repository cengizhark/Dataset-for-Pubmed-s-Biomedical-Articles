Therefore, the final impact of global blockade of these pathways on epileptogenesis may be difficult to predict. Receptor immunoprecipitationCoimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with the use of the Pro-found mammalian coimmunoprecipitation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Furthermore, using primary cultured hippocampal neurons, we show that pCREB is required for the ICER-mediated decrease in GABRA1-p activity and that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway is the endogenous signal that drives the process. Protein (25 μg) extracted from DG was loaded into 10% (for pCREB and pSTATs) or 12% (for CREM/ICER and pSTATs) SDS–polyacrylamide gels and run for 1.5 hours at 110 V. Blots were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 2% milk/tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBS-T) (for pCREB) or 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (for CREM/ICER). The nuclear extract buffer was changed to DNA pull-down buffer C (20 mM tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl) and then protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Annealed oligonucleotides were incubated with beads (200 μmol/mg of beads) for 15 min at room temperature in buffer A. Beads were then washed twice with 500 μl buffer A and three times with 500 μl buffer C (20 mM tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl). After 15 min of incubation, complexes were directly added onto the cells and incubated for 24 hours under normal growth conditions. The transfection was repeated for another 24 hours. We therefore developed a DNA pull-down assay to purify nuclear proteins in DG tissue that specifically recognize the Gabra1:CRE so that these proteins could be identified by gel electrophoresis. 4, C and D), suggesting that BDNF-induced decreases in transcription of α1 may be mediated by an increase in ICER.
