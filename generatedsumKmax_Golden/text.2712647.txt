When the focal plane was at the base of the bundle, the amplitude of the signal in R2 was reduced but in R1 it was increased as observed experimentally, consistent with the reverse diffusion hypothesis. The current view is that the tip link is comprised of two intertwined molecules of cadherin23 at the upper end and two of protocadherin15 at the lower end 9. Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution of composition (in mM): 135 CsCl, 2.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 2.5 Na2ATP, 5 Creatine phosphate, 2 NaAscorbate, 10 CsHEPES, pH 7.2.

The swept-field confocal utilizes a stationary slit scanned with a galvanometer-driven beam also at 500 Hz and synchronized to the camera acquisition speed. This software also generated the voltage and pressure pulses which were fed through a Digidata 1320 DA converter to run the experiment. In contrast in R1, small signals were measured at all three positions but paradoxically the amplitude increased towards the base (Fig. 4b) with a mean slope of 35.4 ± 1.3 pA per stereocilium at a holding potential of −80 mV. One possible reason for the smaller ratio compared to the inner hair cells is that during channel opening the calcium concentration in the stereocilia may be higher due to their smaller diameter and volume producing greater dye saturation.
