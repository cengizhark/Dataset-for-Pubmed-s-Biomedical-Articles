Loss of protective sensation heightens the risk for foot ulceration and lower extremity amputations, and painful symptoms are frequently refractory to treatment [2, 7]. CAN was assessed during DCCT at baseline every 2 years and at DCCT-end and in EDIC during years 13–14 and 16–17, using standard cardiovascular reflex testing (CARTs) that included R–R variation to paced breathing (RRV), R–R response to Valsalva maneuver (VR), and postural changes in blood pressure [26•, 27, 40]. Participants were questioned about autonomic symptoms at EDIC year 13–14 [27, 41]. EURODIAB queried symptoms and changes in heart rate and blood pressure with standing [39, 44], while the UKPDS assessed R–R intervals with deep breathing and standing [18]. CAN prevalence also increased by EDIC year 13–14 (29 % in the intensive vs. 35 % in the conventional group), with treatment group differences remaining significant [26•, 41]. Although one third of DCCT/EDIC participants had CAN by the 13–14th year of EDIC follow-up, few participants reported autonomic symptoms.
