It had been proposed in the early 1970’s that ethanol consumption causes hepatic hypoxia [4]. My dissertation research brought Helmut’s work to light for me. First, he published seminal work demonstrating that cells have steep intracellular oxygen gradients [12], which was critical for justifying the invalidity of using blood oxygen tension to determine intracellular oxygen concentrations. It was in this timeframe that Helmut’s group was describing a new function of selenoproteins (and organoselenium compounds) as peroxynitrite reductases [14]. We also investigated the interaction of catechin oligomers and organotellurium compounds with peroxynitrite and/or it’s degradation products [17–19]. This latter project suggested that selenoprotein P potentially functions as protective ‘coating’ on the glycocalyx, a function similar to what is hypothesized for extracellular superoxide dismutase [21]. Mostly notably, he promoted me to “Arbeitsgruppenleiter” in 1999; Helmut’s Institut was very large and was broken up in smaller research teams (Arbeitsgruppen) with related research themes. I returned to in vivo hepatobiology at the beginning of 2000. Kinetics is king … but concentration is queenWhen a compound (or protein) is called an ‘antioxidant,’ it is most often assumed that this compound directly intercepts a prooxidant (i.e., “free radical scavenger”). Few compounds identified thus far have that rapid of a reaction.This first-approximation approach to predict relevance of a ROS/ RNS interception reaction is informative, but doesn’t take into account other aspects.
