ΔNp63α is the most predominant isoform of p63 expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelia and is overexpressed in several cancers. TaqMan based real-time PCR analysis was performed on ABI Prism7900HT sequence detection system using TaqMan 2× master mix and gene-specific assays on demand. Total protein amounts were measured using BCA protein detection method and equivalent amounts of protein extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and processed for immunoblotting analysis. Mouse monoclonal anti-p63 C-12 antibody was used for detecting exogenous ΔNp63α protein. Fragmented chromatin was pre-cleared using protein G beads and subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-p63 4A4, rabbit polyclonal anti-p63 H-129 and normal mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). At 6 hours post-transfection, fresh medium was added, and after 24 hours, another round of transfection was performed as described above. Slides were mounted using Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs) viewed with a Nikon FXA fluorescence microscope. p63 contains three functional domains, an N-terminal transactivation (TA), a central DNA-binding domain and an oligomerization domain. As expected, we also observed a significant increase in p21 transcript levels with TAp63γ, TAp63β and TAp63α, and ΔNp63β isoforms but not ΔNp63γ and ΔNp63α. ΔNp63α does not inhibit TAp63-mediated induction of VDRSeveral studies have reported that the ΔNp63α isoform exerts a dominant-negative effect towards p53 and TAp63 isoforms. The TP63 gene generates six different isoforms: three TA isoforms (TAp63γ, TAp63β and TAp63α) and three ΔN isoforms (ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β and ΔNp63α) because of the differential promoter usage and alternative splicing. Co-transfection of VDR-Luc, along with increasing concentrations of ΔNp63α, led to a dose-dependent increase in VDR-Luc activity (Fig. The β-actin promoter was used as a negative control (Fig. p63, in particular ΔNp63α, is highly expressed in basal layers of stratified epithelium and is essential for maintenance of epithelial tissue integrity. 6B, compare lanes 3 and 4), which could be attributed to silencing of the endogenous p63.
