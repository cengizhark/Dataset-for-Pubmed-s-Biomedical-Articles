A single passage of cholesterol through the Unisil column results in 95% elution in fraction 1, and 5% elution in fraction 2 (see Supplementary Fig. Oxysterol analysis by electrospray (ES) suffers from their poor ionisation cross-section, while atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoinisation (APPI) both lead to dehydrated protonated molecules and an absence of molecular weight information (15-17). The major sterol in the oxysterol fraction has a m/z of 534.4054 (RA 100%) and appears with retention time (7.35 and 7.65 min, syn/anti forms of the GP hydrazone) identical to that of oxidized and derivatised 24S-hydroxycholesterol (Supplementary Table 1). As the GP hydrazone contains a quaternary nitrogen, the derivatised oxysterol gives a high ion-yield in the ES ion-source (18). The RIC for m/z 552.4160 revealed two components with retention times of 9.23 and 10.03 min. Additionally, here we have detected 5,6-seco-sterol and its aldol in rat brain. The benefit provided by the abundant neutral-loss of 79 Da for the detection of GP derivatives, proves to be a disadvantage for their structural determination. for the loss of 79 Da) and MRM scans, and quadrupole - time-of-flight instruments offer the possibility of exact mass and MS/MS analysis, ion-trap instrument have the advantage of being able to generate MSn spectra. An aliquot was treated with O-methyl hydroxylamine in pyridine at 23°C for 2 h and subsequently trimethylsilylated. Other oxysterols have also been identified in brain (9), including cholest-4-en-3-one (10), and 3β-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (11) (5,6-seco-sterol). This was again applied to the column followed by a wash with 10 mL of 10% methanol. They were then eluted with two portions of 1 mL of methanol followed by 1 mL of chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v). After 1 min at 20% B, the proportion of B was raised to 80% B over the next 7 min, and maintained at 80% B for a further 5 min, before returning to 20% B in 6 s and re-equilibration for a further 3 min 54 s, giving a total run time of 17 min. Ions from the API source, operated in the positive ES mode, are initially stored in the LIT and analysed in either MS or MSn modes.
