Moreover, the duration and magnitude of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was not enhanced in IFN-γ stimulated Irgm1–/– CD4+ T cells, in direct contrast to the augmented STAT1 phosphorylation previously described for SOCS1 deficiency43. IFN-γ is a potent stimulus of autophagy in macrophages and plays an important role in the clearance of pathogens in these cells25,48. The common mechanism underlying these distinct activities is presently unclear although the data presented here suggest the autophagic process as a likely candidate worthy of further investigation. All mice were maintained in specific pathogen free conditions at an AALAC accredited animal facility at the NIAID, NIH (Bethesda, MD) under a study proposal approved by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee. To confirm this finding in a setting in which IFN-γ is completely absent, we crossed Ifng–/– and Irgm1–/– mice to generate animals deficient in both genes. IFN-γ directly triggers death of Irgm1–/– CD4+ T cellsTo characterize the mechanism of IFN-γ dependent suppression of Irgm1–/– CD4+ lymphocytes, we examined the effects of exogenous IFN-γ on the division and death of anti-CD3 activated Ifng–/– and Irgm1–/–Ifng–/– CD4+ T cells.
