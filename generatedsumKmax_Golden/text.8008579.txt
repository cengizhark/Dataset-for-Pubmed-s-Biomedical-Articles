Classical steroid hormone receptors include the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, estrogen receptor beta, and the progesterone receptor. All these studies analyzed adults because many symptoms of these disorders are diagnosed later in life (with the exception of ASD and Tourette Disorder, which show symptoms early in life). In the case of both male- and female-typical behaviors, adult concentrations of circulating hormones are the second necessary component for the full complement of sex-typical physiological or behavioral phenotypes to manifest. These data suggest that sex-specific responses to systemic inflammation during the juvenile period may predict adolescent behavioral outcomes. In contrast, only microglial-depletion females showed a blunting of the acute stress response in adulthood (Nelson and Lenz, 2016), whereas only males showed evidence of impaired sexual behavior (VanRyzin et al , 2016), similar to inhibiting microglia with minocycline during the early neonatal period (Lenz et al , 2013). Behavioral outcomes of this masculinization process include a strong motivation to mount sexually receptive females, intromit, and ejaculate, and additionally to engage in male-male aggressive behaviors (Fig. This study shows that sex-specific hormone receptor interactions can both promote resilience to mood-related dysfunction as well as contribute to stress-induced mood dysregulation. As with major depression, stress during pregnancy is a major risk factor for postpartum depression (PPD) (Beck, 2001).
