In all samples with SirT1 deleted, there were reductions in Nanog and Klf2 proteins and increases in Fgf5 and Otx2 proteins (Figure 3C). In this report, we describe a close association between SirT1 and Oct4 in embryonic stem cells, both physically and functionally. In addition, human induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells also exhibit features of the primed state of pluripotency (Yamanaka et al , 2007; Yu et al , 2007), while mouse IPS cells naturally revert to the naïve state (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). For example, toxic environmental agents could trigger DNA damage, activation of PARPs, depletion of NAD and inactivation of SirT1, thereby imposing a roadblock to continued embryonic development. Co-IPs were performed using Pierce’s direct co-IP kit. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation qPCRChromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling). Oct4 enhancer activity shifts from a distal enhancer dependent on Oct4 itself in naïve cells to a proximal, Oct4-independent enhancer in primed cells without affecting the total expression level of the gene (Buecker et al , 2014; Yang et al , 2014). We also found that SirT1 is localized within the nucleus as evidenced by its colocalization with DAPI and the activating histone modification, (H3K4me3)(Heintzman et al , 2007) (Figure 1D).
