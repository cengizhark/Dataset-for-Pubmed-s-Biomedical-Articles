Two known processes that contribute to declining firing rates in the LGMD during sustained stimulation are feed-forward inhibition14,15 and spike-frequency adaptation16. 6aâ€“e).After confirming our ability to approximate the current injection results, we turned our attention to the contribution the simulated KCa conductance could make to visual processing. Our results suggest that spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) in the LGMD is mostly mediated by an SK-like calcium dependent potassium (KCa) conductance. 5), suggesting that the localization of the KCa conductance is optimized for maximal impact of its inhibitory effect35. Studies in model systems such as the LGMD, for which relatively detailed knowledge of a behavioral role exists, reveal that the functions of individual conductances are often highly specific in their contribution to the overall neural computations carried out by their respective neurons. Instantaneous firing frequency curves were calculated as described previously16. The AHP time constant was fitted as described previously16. Cadmium saline (as before, but with 1 mM Cd2+, 0 mM Ca2+, 10 mM Mg2+) was added using a gravity perfusion system, as was high-K+ saline (95 mM, versus 5 mM in control). Model output was analyzed like experimental data, with N = 25 runs for all visual simulations. Behaviorally, it has been demonstrated that the timing of the phases of the locust jump also occur after the crossing of fixed angular threshold sizes10. Additionally, several SK antagonists and agonists failed to produce an effect (Supplementary Pharmacology and Supplementary Fig. Like Cd2+, ChTX reduced f0 (Fig.
