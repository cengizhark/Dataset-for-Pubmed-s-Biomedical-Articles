Future epidemiological studies of TORC1 gene mutations in affected populations should provide further insight in this regard. The wild-type allele was amplified using primers A and C (5′-ATTCCTCATATACCTCTCTTCTGGTGC-3′). The mutant allele was amplified using primers A and D (5′-GCATGAATCAACTTTGGAGACATGCG-3′). Locomotor activity, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were simultaneously measured with a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (Columbus), as previously described 44. Blood and Plasma MeasurementsFor whole blood and plasma measurements, mouse blood was collected from the tail vein into EDTA-coated capillary tubes (StatSpin). Blood glucose levels were determined prior to the test and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min following the injection. Body weight and food intake were measured daily for 10 days, starting after the implantation of the minipumps. Colchicine was injected over a 15min period through the cannula using a hamilton syringe. Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused for brain immunohistochemistry 36h after colchicine treatment. Brains were post-fixed for 2h at 4°C and then incubated in 0.05 M potassium-PBS (K-PBS) containing 15% (w/v) sucrose 4°C for 12–16 hr. The primary antibodies used were P-STAT3 Y705 (1:1000, #9145, Cell Signaling Technologies), KISS1 (1:1000, #9754, Chemicon), CART (1:10000, #6838, PBL-Salk Institute), and TORC1 (1:2500, #6938, PBL-Salk Institute). The partial β-Gal cDNA was PCR amplified and cloned from the gene-trap cassette isolated from TORC1 −/− mice. Tissue sections were digested with proteinase K (10μg/mL) for 30 min at 37°C, acetylated and dehydrated prior to hybridization. Sections were subsequently treated with ribonuclease A (20μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, washed with 0.1× SSC buffer (65–85°C), dehydrated and exposed to x-ray films (β-max; Eastman Kodak) for 1–2 d. Slides were then coated with Kodak NTB-2 liquid emulsion, and exposed at 4°C for 3–4 weeks. Cell Culture, Transfections and Luciferase AssaysThe mouse hypothalamic cell line GT1-7 was a gift from Dr. Pam Mellon (UCSD). Cell lysates were prepared and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were determined, as described previously 8. Brain Region DissectionsHypothalamic tissue was dissected as described previously 46 with a slight modification. The brain was sliced coronally with a razor blade to generate a block spanning from the optic chiasm to the rostral end of the mammillary bodies. These cuts also generated two amygdala-enriched regions, lateral to the hypothalamus, and a cortex-enriched region dorsal to the external capsule. For tissue, animals were anesthetized (350 μg/kg chloral hydrate, i.p.) and the relevant tissue or brain region was rapidly dissected out and snap-frozen in liquid N2 or immersed in RNA later for 12 to 16h at 4°C. Following crosslink reversal, and proteinase K treatment, DNA was isolated by two rounds of phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Western blots for TORC1, TORC2, CREB and P-CREB Ser133 were performed using antibodies 6939E1, 6865, 244, 5322, respectively (Salk Institute). Five to eight matched arcuate-containing sections from whole-brain series were counted from independent experiments.
