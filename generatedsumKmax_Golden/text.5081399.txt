These patterns on a systemic level appear to be temporally coordinated by neuronal and chemical networks which are in turn maintained by various timekeeping mechanisms in the central nervous system (Figure 1) [7]. The timing of food intake has as much of an impact, if not more, on energy homeostasis as the nutritional content of the diet and gut signaling. Polyamines also regulate the activity of core clock proteins by modulating the interaction of PER2 and CRY1 [81]. Furthermore, in mice, FXR activation in hepatocytes, or FXR-mediated release of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) from the terminal ileum, play a modulatory role in lipid and glucose homeostasis [87]. TGR5 (G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, GPBAR1), another BA receptor, also plays an important regulatory role in host metabolism [88]. Recent studies show that the gut microbiome is far more dynamic than previously imagined. In addition, the dynamic fluctuations in the gut micro-biome can lead to cyclical fluctuation of primary and secondary BAs which can modulate FXR and TGR5 activation and downstream signaling, affecting energy expenditure and influencing cholesterol, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. However, in the absence of any food intake only ~350 hepatic transcripts are rhythmic in a 24 h period [28].
