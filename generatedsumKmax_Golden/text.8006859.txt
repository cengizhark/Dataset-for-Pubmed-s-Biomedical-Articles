This is consistent with the fact that p-TEFb (cyclin T1/Cdk9) associates with different partners besides SEC (e.g., BET domain proteins) (Luo et al , 2012a), and further implicates that the Pfn1/SEC interaction is mediated directly by the PLP motif in ENL. As the first actin-binding protein identified decades ago (Carlsson et al , 1977), the role of Pfn1, the ubiquitously expressed Pfn isoform, has been well demonstrated in cytoplasmic actin polymerization (Jockusch et al , 2007) and underlies its essentiality for many eukaryotic organisms (Balasubramanian et al , 1994; Verheyen and Cooley, 1994; Witke et al , 2001). Though largely unexplored in cancer, XPO6 mRNA level is a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer (Hao et al , 2016). Mouse anti-BrdU antibody for immunofluorescence staining (B2531) was purchased from Sigma. Silent mutations resistant to shPFN1 #1 and #2 were introduced in human Pfn1 cDNA by QuickChange: AGC to TCG (nucleotide 253-255) and TTG to CTC (nucleotide 367-369). Briefly, 30 μl samples were mixed with 200 μl UA buffer consisting of 8M urea (Sigma, U5128) in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and added to Microcon YM-30 filter units (Millipore, MRCF0R030). Samples were spun for 15 min at 14,000 x g and washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer by centrifugation at the same speed for the same length of time. For Data dependent acquisitions, mass spectra and tandem mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion and high-sensitivity mode. Advanced information-dependent acquisition (IDA) was used for MS/MS collection on the TripleTOF 5600 to obtain MS/MS spectra for the 20 most abundant parent ions following each survey MS1 scan (allowing typically for 80 ms acquisition time per each MS/MS). Data were analyzed by Python 3.8 for statistical significance with the Scipy, Pingouin, and Scikit Posthocs packages. Raw data had been processed through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) and provided as log2 transformed normalized values against a common pool of reference samples. XPO6 knockdown caused no growth inhibition of Pfn1-null chondrocytes infected with an empty vector or YFP (Figures 4C and 4D).
