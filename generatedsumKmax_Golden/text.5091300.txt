Neurons in the vestibular nucleus neurons are influenced by static neck position in mice(Medrea and Cullen 2013) and a similar behavior has been shown in cats(Boyle and Pompeiano 1981; Anastasopoulos and Mergner 1982; Wilson et al  1990). These findings are consistent with HOT not biasing how surge motion is perceived or changing the threshold of perception. Given what is known we felt that the method used to measure the PSE in these experiments is reasonable and accurate. This problem could be solved using temporal integration of the angular velocity signal that arises in the semicircular canals(Green and Angelaki 2003; Zhou et al  2006). Inactivation of the semicircular canals leads to erroneous eye movements in response to translation(Angelaki et al  1999) which supports this hypothesis. Studies which have shown an erroneous perception can be induced after prolonged rotations which activate the velocity storage mechanism which supports a role for the semicircular canals(Merfeld et al  1999; Merfeld et al  2001). Modeling of this type of data suggests that the tilt-translation ambiguity can be solved using canal and otolith signals alone(Zupan et al  2004). StimuliThe stimulus consisted of a 2s (0.5 Hz) sine wave in acceleration. The wave was multiplied by the first cycle of a 0.25 Hz sine wave so that the intensity was largest near the peak velocity of the movement with a maximum amplitude of 0.6 mm. The wave was multiplied by the first cycle of a 0.25 Hz sine wave so that the intensity was largest near the peak velocity of the movement with a maximum amplitude of 0.6 mm. The wave was multiplied by the first cycle of a 0.25 Hz sine wave so that the intensity was largest near the peak velocity of the movement with a maximum amplitude of 0.6 mm. tilt) or linear acceleration due to translation(Graybiel et al  1979; Paige and Tomko 1991; Seidman et al  1998; Angelaki et al  2004; Zhou et al  2006; Green and Angelaki 2007; Angelaki and Cullen 2008; Osler and Reynolds 2012). They were told that each stimulus would consistent of either forward or backward motion and that their task was to identify the direction.
