1A and data file S1). Briefly, CS was obtained from adult (aged 6 to 12 weeks) male caeca and resuspended in dextrose 5% water (D5W; Baxter, JB0081) at a concentration of 160 mg CS/ml D5W and then passed through a 70-μm filter (Falcon, 352350). This strategy allowed for injection volumes and dosages of LPS to be similar between litters that varied in weight. The probes used for Cebp-β and Cebp-α were designed with a 5′FAM and a 3′QSY quencher to be run in duplex with the housekeeping gene, but in separate wells from each other. Hematoxylin and eosin and Ly6G staining was performed on separate but serial sections, and scoring by trained pathologists was performed blinded to treatment group and to study hypotheses. Differences were considered significant with P < 0.05, and exact P values or different thresholds of P values were presented in each figure legend. Representative flow cytometry plots of BCG-induced increase in total neutrophils and proportional increase in mature neutrophils.Fig. S5A), yet transfer of purified mature neutrophils did (Fig. 3F, with flow cytometry gating strategy shown in fig.
