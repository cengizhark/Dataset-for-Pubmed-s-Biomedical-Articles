For the behavioral experiments in which multiple factors were evaluated, ANOVA was used and significant interactions were deconstructed along the relevant factor to examine main effects and group differences followed up with t-tests. All other data analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (Version 8.3.0). With regard to Hnrnph1, a human candidate gene association study identified a functional intronic variant in OPRM1 (mRNA target of hnRNP H) that affected binding to hnRNP H to regulate splicing and was associated with the severity of heroin addiction (51). Psychostimulant use disorders (PUDs), including methamphetamine (MA) and cocaine dependence, are a serious public health concern in the United States. on Days 3, 4, and 5 and were video-recorded for distance traveled over 60 min using Anymaze (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) as previously described (28). RNA samples were bioanalyzed (RIN > 8) and cDNA library was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Standard mRNA LT (100 bp paired-end reads). One notable example was the identification of a genome-wide association between FAM53B and cocaine dependence in humans (4). One notable example was the identification of a genome-wide association between FAM53B and cocaine dependence in humans (4). This is one of the first examples demonstrating a direct correspondence between genome-wide genetic association, functional changes in gene expression, and trait-relevant behaviors (cocaine self-administration) between rodents and humans. 30 μg of protein was heated in a 70°C water bath for 10 min before loading into a 4 – 20% Criterion TGX precast Midi protein gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat# 5671094) for SDS-PAGE followed by wet transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% milk for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies. For quantification analysis of protein expression, total protein stains were used as loading controls in normalization for immunoblotting quantification (42, 43). Cells were split every 3 to 4 days and were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.For HEK293T, cells were seeded in 6-well plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well 24 hours prior to transfection and would be about 90% confluent at the time of transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the experimental firefly luciferase construct and 0.2 μg internal pRL control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase driven by the CMV promoter (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; Cat# E2261). 24 hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were detached with 0.25% of Trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat# 25200056) and counted and re-seeded at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells per well in 96-well plate.
