Found C, 62.20; H, 5.40; N, 10.06.Continued elution gave the β-linked derivative 11b as colorless syrup 11.3 g, 9.2%. HRMS (ESI-TOF): m/z [M+Na]+ calcd for C22H25O4N3SNa 450.1463, found 450.1459.Continued elution gave the β-linked glycoside 7b as colorless syrup (2.1 g, 1.8%, Total 99.4 g, 86% overall, α/β ∼ 46:1). Red color developed immediately and, after 20 min, when TLC (Solvent 1, Rf = 0.72 at 4:1 hexane–EtOAc. The residue was chromatographed (10:1 hexane– EtOAc) and title compound 14 was obtained as colorless syrup (47.9 g, 94%), [α]D +23.8 (c 1.0, CHCl3). TMSOTf (4.7 mL, 26.1 mmol) was added, whereupon red color developed immediately. An additional advantage of the approach described here is that the stereoselectivity of the critical glycosylation reaction, which converted the terminal determinant to a conjugation-ready form, was substantially increased by controlling it thermodynamically.2, 6 The crude product was passed through a short pad of silica and elution with 5:1 hexane–EA afforded pure 4 as white solid. HRMS analysis of the crude product confirmed formation of the desired coupling product only (HRMS (ESI-TOF): m/z [M+H+] calcd for C131H177O49N6Si 2646.1312; found 2646.1313),. That the predominant isomer contained the desired α-configuration followed from the 13C-1H coupling constant for the 13C carbon involved in the newly formed interglycosidic linkage. In most situations across carbohydrate chemistry, synthesis of the 1,2-trans-glycosidic linkage is not problematic because a participating group can be introduced into 2-positions of the glycosyl donors. One of our major targets has been a conjugate vaccine for cholera from synthetic fragments of O-SPs of Vibrio cholerae.1–3 The data were processed using the Bruker APEX III software package. The crystal structure was solved and refined using the SHELXL21 software package.
