BAC DNA from positive co-integrates was injected into pronuclei from FVB/N oocytes to generate transgenic mice.For the D2R-DARPP-32/Myc mouse, a 484bp segment of the Drd2 promoter corresponding to the region immediately adjacent to the start codon was placed 5’ to mouse DARPP-32 cDNA containing a c-terminal Myc tag (SEQKLISEEDL). Venus cDNA was excised from the vector and replaced with ECFP cDNA (Clontech). Sections were acetylated for 10 minutes and then dehydrated in a series of ethanols and incubated overnight at 55°C in a humidity chamber with 2 × 106 cpm of probe per slide mixed in hybridization buffer. The next day slides were washed 4 times in 4x SSC and incubated with RNAse A for 15 minutes at 37°C. Samples were stored at −80°C until used for immunoblotting.Flag IP/homogenate mixtures were spun down for 30 seconds at 13,000 rpm and unbound supernatant was removed to a fresh tube. 1ul of this unbound supernatant was used in a BCA protein assay (Pierce) to determine protein concentration. The brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated Krebs–HCO3− buffer (124 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4 and 10 mM d-glucose, pH 7.4).
