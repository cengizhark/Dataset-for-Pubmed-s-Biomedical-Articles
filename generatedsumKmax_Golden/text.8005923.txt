This study included data from our own University College London (UCL) SCZ case control sample. There is no reported GWAS evidence for MCPH1 association with BPD or SCZ [Group 2011; Hou and others 2016; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics 2014], however, the association finding reported here warrants replication in a larger sample. rs61749465 is located in the conserved N-terminal BRCT1 domain of the MCPH1 protein. MCPH1 is also known as BRIT1 (BRCT-repeat inhibitor of the transcriptional repressor of human telomere reverse transcriptase, hTERT) [Jackson and others 2002]. MCPH1 is also known as BRIT1 (BRCT-repeat inhibitor of the transcriptional repressor of human telomere reverse transcriptase, hTERT) [Jackson and others 2002]. 2.1.UCL Participant samplesAll cases in our study had received a clinical diagnosis of SCZ or BPD according to the International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) and were interviewed by a psychiatrist or trained researcher using the lifetime version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version (SADS-L) schedule to confirm the diagnosis [Spitzer 1977]. Both the second and third phases (UCL2 and UCL3) included participants with BPD-II that were extracted either saliva or blood [Dedman and others 2012; Fiorentino and others 2015]The UCL control sample consisted of 1820 volunteers, 1340 of whom were interviewed with the initial clinical screening questions of the SADS-L and selected on the basis of not having a past or present personal history of any Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) defined mental disorder. The remaining 480 DNA samples were unscreened healthy British volunteers collected by the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (ECACC).All cases and controls were of UK or Irish ancestry [Datta and others 2007]. DNA was extracted from blood samples using phenol-chloroform [Pereira and others 2011] and BACC-DNA Extraction kits (Illustra Nucleon Genomic, GE Healthcare, UK). cDNA synthesis was prepared adding 1 μg of RNA preparation to 0.1 M DTT (dithiothritol), RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (recombinant RNasin, Promega, UK) and 5 μl SuperScript III RT (200 U/μL) and 5X First-Strand Buffer. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at 25°C, followed by 50 min at 50°C. 125 nucleotide single read RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq v4 sequencer (Eurofins, Germany). Adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic [Bolger and others 2014].
