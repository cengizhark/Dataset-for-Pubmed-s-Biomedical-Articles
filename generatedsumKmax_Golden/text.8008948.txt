This long-term, multi-method study identified a previously unrecognized potential social-developmental pathway from a range of interpersonal behaviors beginning in adolescence to disruption of basic physiological and social processes in adulthood. We posit that adolescents who experience the insidious stressor of overcontrolling parenting could well have both difficulty physiologically rising to the challenge of a stressor, which involves both upregulating sympathetic and downregulating parasympathetic functions. The current findings are consistent with the idea of allostatic load: Individuals who experience chronic stressors are compromised in their ability to respond physiologically to maintain homeostasis. These participants also went on to cope by denying the existence of problems. Individuals who begin adolescence with serious intrusions on their autonomy are likely to be set upon a maladaptive path that is stressful and taxing. In addition, interventions such as assertiveness training in adolescence and young adulthood may be of particular relevance to cardiovascular functioning. Withdrawn individuals are also likely to form relationships with similarly withdrawn partners, reinforcing these maladaptive interpersonal styles (Collins, Cooper, Albino, & Allard, 2002; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001; Stanley, Markman, & Whitton, 2002). To maximize the number of romantic partners able to participate, dyads were recruited if they had an eligible romantic partner at any time within a span of three years to complete observational and questionnaire measures. Participants’ and partners’ scores were averaged together to capture the amount of autonomy and relatedness shown at the dyadic level, an approach previously found to yield highly valid data (Allen et al , 2003).
