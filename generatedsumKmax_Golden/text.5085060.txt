Neither the overall number of MGE type cINs or the their layer distribution was significantly altered in mutants (Figure 7D and Figure S12A–C). Our subsequent analysis of the Lmo3 null animal revealed a significant reduction in Pv+ cINs and an increase in SST+ cINs without significantly affecting the overall number of MGE type cINs. This is consistent with our findings that Lhx6 in situ was normal in e15.5 cortex (Figure S14) and layer distribution postnatally for Pv+ and SST+ cINs was normal in Lmo3 null mice (Figure S12B–E). Cultures were fixed at day 11 for immunocytochemistry.For neuronal monolayer cultures, day 11 EBs were gently and completely dissociated with Accutase (15 minutes, 37°C followed by gentle trituration with P200 tip 10-15x) and plated at 200 000 cells/cm2 on poly-L-lysine/laminin and maintained in Neurobasal + B27 medium. Following surgery, the uterus was carefully replaced and the dam was sewn up, allowing host pups to be birthed normally. At postnatal day 21, host animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused in preparation for immunohistochemical analysis. There was, however, a significant enhancement in the total number of cINs present in the cortex with Nkx2-1 GOF, an effect that mirrored the increase in Dlx5/6-eGFP+ neurons when the lines were differentiated in vivo. This effect was even greater with the addition of Dlx2 (Nkx2-1/Dlx2 GOF) where we observed a further increase in the number of cINs that reached the cortex (Figure 4G).
