Hoechst easily detected condensed or fragmented nuclei and the vital probe propidium iodide excluded necrotic cells with damaged cell membranes. In some studies we used an Olympus FV1000-MPE confocal/multiphoton microscope equipped with a Spectra Physics MaiTai Deep See laser and gallium arsenide 12-bit detectors. In Figure 3, we followed the Phiphilux signal in a sham wild-type kidney volume over a 2 hour time period, imaging intermittently every 30 minutes. Sixty minutes following reperfusion, Phiphilux positive S2 cells with condensed nuclei suggestive of apoptosis could be easily detected in random fields (Fig. That this Phiphilux signal in apoptotic S2 cells is indeed a read-out of caspase 3 activity could theoretically be confirmed by performing the ischemia reperfusion experiment in caspase 3 KO mice.
