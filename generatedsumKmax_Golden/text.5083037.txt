Thus, the high-functioning group exhibited deficits in the higher-order association cortex (regarding both functional and structural connectivity), while exhibiting no differences in the primary sensory and motor cortices. Social impairmentSix studies have reported negative correlations between RS connectivity and social impairment in ASD subjects (reported as negative correlations with the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Reciprocal Social Interaction score or ADOS–Social Scale score).19,22,30,31,33,55 The connections involved in four of these studies were between the following: PCC and temporal lobe, posterior parahippocampal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus;31 PCC and right superior frontal gyrus;30 PCC and right medial temporal gyrus;22 and right hemisphere motor cortex and thalamus.55 The other two studies reported negative correlations between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the synchronization between left and right hemisphere inferior frontal gyri,19 and between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the total precuneus connectivity z-scores.33 Kewon and colleagues56 reported a negative correlation between average local degrees of connectivity, the number of other regions to which the ROI connected, and social impairment (reported as a negative correlation with ADOS–Social Scale scores). In addition, as a spatial average of potentially many discrete directional components that may be present within a voxel, the average direction of the tissue in a voxel may not match any of the specific orientations that reside within. Bulk changes in cerebral hemodynamics associated with changes in neural activity associated with specific tasks can be localized by using well-designed behavioral tasks that tease apart the component functions associated with the specific tasks (task-based fMRI). From these primary tabulations of the literature, we sought to express the observed major findings in a more directly comparable manner. The imaging parameters varied widely. The imaging parameters varied widely. The gender ratio also varied widely, from all-male groups to mixed-gender groups.
