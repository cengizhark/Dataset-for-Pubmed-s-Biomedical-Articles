Overall, the observational studies in this review have included relevant outcomes but are subject to biases from residual confounding and measurement error (e.g. Also, many of these studies assume that outcomes are consistent regardless of the type of antihypertensive deprescribed, which is unlikely given that antihypertensives are used for various other CV and renal indications. Notably, no antihypertensive deprescribing studies used an active comparator (i.e., deprescribing of another class of drugs not expected to affect the outcome of interest) and negative outcome control to help reduce bias, such as increased surveillance for medication-related problems or confounding by indication [38,39]. These deprescribing RCTs mainly assessed the impact of interventions to de-intensify antihypertensive medications on process measures such as number of antihypertensives and changes in BP, and less often examined patient-centered outcomes (e.g., CV events, mortality, adverse drug events). Compared to usual care, deprescribing rates were higher in the deprescribing intervention group, with no significant differences in secondary outcomes of changes in pulse or SBP among those deprescribed. Another study included Medicare beneficiaries in NHs and assessed the association between number of antihypertensives and CV and non-CV outcomes, stratified by diagnosis of dementia [8]. The Health ABC cohort study did not find an association between use of antihypertensives (measured by participant interview) with recurrent falls in the following year [42].
