Coronal sections of the cerebral cortex showed midline fusion of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. The microphthalmic eyes presented small or absent lenses (Fig. The mutation may be present outside the coding region of one of the known causative genes or it may lie in an unknown gene in the biosynthetic pathway of dystroglycan. The amplicons generated were purified and directly sequenced with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). POMT1 and LARGE were sequenced by PreventionGenetics. The solubilized fraction was incubated with WGA-agarose beads (Vector Labs) for 24 h. The beads were then washed with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and the bound protein was eluted with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 300 mmN-acetyl d-glucosamine. Adult or embryonic tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5 µm sections were cut on an RM2135 microtome (Leica). For immunofluorescence, 3- to 4-week-old brains and eyes were fresh frozen in isopentane cooled by dry ice, and 8 µm sections were cut on a CM3050S cryostat (Leica). Laminin binding is also lost after chemical deglycosylation, and it is blocked by competition with the IIH6 antibody (Ervasti and Campbell, 1993). The specificity of the assay was confirmed by laminin overlay on immunoblots of α-dystroglycan purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and WGA-enriched extracts of human brain (Fig. The integrity of these basement membranes was examined by immunofluorescence detection of laminin and perlecan.
