We characterized neurite tracts in the embryonic ventral ganglion that typically consists of bilaterally symmetric longitudinal fascicles connected across the midline via repeated pairs of commissure bundles. These results demonstrate that Dscam+19 plays a more important role than Dscam−19 in the development of the Drosophila embryonic CNS. Dscam+19 is primarily used during embryogenesis, whereas Dscam−19 abundantly exists in the post-embryonic nervous system (Figure 3D and 3F). Dscam+19 is primarily used during embryogenesis, whereas Dscam−19 abundantly exists in the post-embryonic nervous system (Figure 3D and 3F). Consistent with these expression profiles, endogenous Dscam−19 plays an essential role in post-embryonic neuronal morphogenesis (Figure 2J and Figure 4C), while Dscam+19 plays a role in the formation of embryonic CNS (Figure 3D and Figure 4F). FliesTransgenic flies carrying various UAS-RNAis were obtained by P element-mediated germ line transformation with technical support from Genetic Services, Inc. As to the induction of UAS-19RNAi (Figure 2C) versus UAS-18/20RNAi (Figure 2B), the ladder-like patterns of immunostaining, though weakened, looked morphologically indistinguishable from those seen in control embryos (Figure 2A). Pan-neuronal induction of either UAS-19RNAi (Figure 2K) or UAS-23RNAi (Figure 2O) to deplete Dscam+19 or Dscam+23 minimally affected the expression pattern or level of endogenous Dscam. Upon induction of UAS-18/20RNAi to eliminate Dscam−19 (Figure 2J), the residual Dscam, though barely detectable, existed in a similar pattern to that of control animals (Figure 2I). Further, a similar ladder-like pattern of immunocytochemical signals, which was eliminated in Dscam-null embryos, was detected following immunostaining of wild-type embryos with the Ab18 (Figure 3A–3B) or Ab19 (Figure 3D–3E).
