Error bars reflect the between groups standard error of the mean. We first used the staurosporine-derivative bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), GF 109203X at a range of doses that have been shown to inhibit PKC (Herbert et al , 1990; Toullec et al , 1991) and affect pain behavior when administered intrathecally (Yashpal et al , 1995; Heinke and Sandkuhler, 2005; Hua et al , 1999). If, as suggested above, NMDAR conductances are altered by increased PKC phosphorylation following DHPG or uncontrollable shock, the threshold for synaptic modification may shift downward (Figure 8B). Recent data indicate that glutamate-mediated cell death may involve plasticity and trafficking of iGluRs (Hermann et al , 2001; Beattie et al , 2002; Ogoshi et al , 2005; Stellwagen et al , 2005). Surgery and intrathecal cannulizationSurgery and intrathecal cannulization were performed using procedures described in detail elsewhere (Grau et al , 1998; Ferguson et al , 2003; Ferguson et al , 2006). The exposed end of tubing was secured to the adjacent tissue using cyanoacrylate. To prevent injury to the hind limbs during recovery, the rear legs of spinalized animals were maintained in a normal flexed position by two pieces of porous tape (Orthaletic, 1.3 cm [width]) gently wrapped once around the rat's body. The state of this circuit was sampled at 30 Hz.Flexion force was measured prior to instrumental testing using a strain gauge connected to the foot by a monofilament plastic line ("4 lb test" Stren, Dupont). This plasticity of plasticity or ‘metaplasticity’ (Abraham and Bear, 1996; Abraham and Tate, 1997) is associated with trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors (Hellier et al , 2007). iGluR function can be affected by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and activation of downstream protein kinase C (PKC). For the group I mGluR experiments drugs were purchased from Tocris (Ellisvile, MO) and subjects were given 1 of 4 doses of drug dissolved in 3 μl of vehicle. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 g, 4ºC for 30 min. A proprietary PKC substrate (Stressgen Bioreagents) was pre-coated on the wells of the microtiter plate. Next, the microtiter plate was incubated with a phospho-specific IgG antibody to label all the phosphorylated sites resulting from active PKC in the samples. Fresh lysis buffer (without cord lysate) was included in the assay as a blank, and cord lysate without ATP served as the negative control.
