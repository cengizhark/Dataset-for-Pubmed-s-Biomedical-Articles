9.Photobleach correctionIn the data spreadsheet for glycolytically inhibited axons, subtract the mean fluorescence of frame 1 (the pre-activation frame) from the mean fluorescence of each frame starting at frame 3 (the first timelapse frame) for a given ROI. This mouse permits the analysis of neurofilament transport in situ using fluorescence microscopy. The total loss of fluorescent neurofilament polymer from this central window per second (dQcdt) is the sum of the losses due to fluorescent neurofilament polymers leaving in anterograde and retrograde directions, i.e. At early times, the flanking windows capture all the neurofilaments that exit the central window because these filaments do not have sufficient time to pass through the flanking windows and exit them on the other side. Normalized to the initial content of fluorescent neurofilament polymer in the central window, the rates of increase in the flanking windows become However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this discrepancy between the central and flanking slopes could also be due, at least in part, to underestimation of the extent of photobleaching (see Discussion), which would have the effect of underestimating the positive slopes in the flanking windows and overestimating the negative slope in the central window. We will discuss later the selection of sample sizes for experiments, however here we used one nerve in normal saline and two in inhibitory saline, due to the limitation of one acquisition field per nerve during inhibition. 2.Initial assembly of nerve perfusion chamberConnect the syringe and the tubing as shown in Figure 1A, placing the outflow tube into a waste flask.Place the outer gasket into the perfusion chamber housing, ensuring that the flow inlet and outlet posts are aligned with the holes in the gasket.Lay the inner gasket (silicone, 100 Âµm thick) on a #1.5 circular coverslip (40 mm diameter), carefully smoothing out any wrinkles in the gasket to ensure a tight seal. This z-stack acquisition is necessary to capture the maximal fluorescence across the field of view as the coverslip is rarely perfectly horizontal and the plane of fluorescein fluorescence is very narrow.
