A supervised approach to training the algorithm includes setting clear rules that the computer must follow. Additionally, computer scientists must learn about health conditions and the human response to those conditions, and how that response may influence activity and behavior patterns. Health experiences are captured through weekly nursing interviews using semi-structured questions that regard health or status changes in the preceding 7 days. When an event has occurred (e.g., a fall, an episode of RLS), in addition to describing the activities the resident was engaging in around the time of the event, we observe the naturalistic setting in which the health event occurred (i.e., the home). Health technologies are designed to assist with solving real-world health problems that humans experience. As such, the development of these technologies requires situational, naturalistic knowledge along with the strongest possible phenomenological explanation to ensure the technology can meet the humanâ€™s health needs.
