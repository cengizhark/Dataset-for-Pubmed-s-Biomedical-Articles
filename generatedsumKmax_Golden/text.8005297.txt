In what follows, we first discuss the influence and impact of anesthesia on imaging modalities as well as provide example protocols that are used in our facilities. This invasion can proceed along a portion of the implant edge, or is sometimes be confined to a single point, such as a physical opening between the implant and the bone, or the area around an insufficiently sealed screw.On T1 MRI, tissue growth, primarily granulation tissue, or liquid can be identified as light gray or white (i.e. Unless trained to present limbs for blood collection, even this routine clinical procedure requires anesthesia in NHP. Hypocapnia has also been shown to be useful in anesthesia of patients with large intracranial abscesses.If the researcher has the capability of performing imaging early (both baseline and early in the course of illness, post-operative conditions, and so on), as well as doing them frequently for all implanted animals, then hypocapnia is not required for every anesthetic period. With the increase in the availability of imaging tools and procedures in research facilities, particularly MRI, we are now well-poised to make significant advances in improving the well-being, clinical care and experimental outcomes of laboratory NHPs. Attention to imaging modality as well as whether or not anesthesia is used and how, will further improve experimental and clinical outcomes. Our effort here is to provide information to scientists and veterinarians interested in taking advantage of modern imaging approaches at their facilities and to foster further discussions and interactions between scientists and veterinarians aimed at improving laboratory NHP well-being and health and experimental outcomes.
