We firmly believe that regulation of ROS and the kynurenine pathway could be influenced by interactions with viral pathogens and should be considered during development of novel antiviral drugs and therapies. We firmly believe that regulation of ROS and the kynurenine pathway could be influenced by interactions with viral pathogens and should be considered during development of novel antiviral drugs and therapies. Thus, there are a large number of patients who require other therapy and may be more at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent severe disease. These novel findings can lead to new care plans for these patients by targeting tumor metabolism. Importantly, we believe that various tumor metabolic characteristics may be applied to screen for patients susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Covid-19/ SARS-CoV-2 airway mediated infection has increased lethality in immunocompromised patients, and many US hospitals are being flooded positive inpatients at this time. Currently, the impact of tumor metabolism on the tumor microenvironment is not well established and any correlation of SARS-COV-2 infection is unknown.
