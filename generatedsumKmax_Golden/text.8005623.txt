The SSPR is then calculated by multiplying this constant concentration in μg/liter by the collection medium flow rate in liter/min and then dividing the result by the glove piece area in cm2 contacted by the collection medium. In studies using volume replacement with solvent after sampling, accurate results may not occur when mixing or solubility are inadequate. The minimum number of chemotherapy agents to be tested is nine. Higher SSPRs were found for ISO cells. The SSPR data depended on collection gas flow rate. [9] The United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has strategies for estimating dermal exposure and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). [10] The American Industrial Hygiene Association from 2008–2011 did have a Biological Environmental Exposure Level Project Team for skin risk assessment. KCP, using an open-loop gas collection method at room temperature, reported a NBT for limonene of 105 min for this glove. The Phalen data did show decreases in NBT and increases for SSPR for hand movement when disposable nitrile gloves were challenged with ethanol. A common directive in safety data sheets is to “Use the appropriate glove”, something that has to be determined by a professional who needs to understand the factors involved and to employ “professional judgment.” Part of the latter involves the application of past history to current practice. Thin gloves allow more facile manipulation of work pieces and greater wearer comfort than the thicker ones of the same material. [2,15–22] Permeation may occur without any observable effects on glove materials. The mathematical model for non-Fickian diffusion is much more complex with D no longer simply related to L2, but to variables related to materials being non-isotropic and the inner structure of each material.
