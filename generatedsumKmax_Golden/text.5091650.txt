Chronic agomelatine administration promotes brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, leading to a net increase in hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents (92, 104). Formation of MT1/MT2 heterodimers is 3- to 4-fold lower than the formation of MT1/MT1 homodimers and is similar to the formation of MT2/MT2 homodimers (32) (Figure 2). These two distinct effects of melatonin (i.e., sleep promotion and phase shift of circadian rhythms) resulting from actions at melatonin receptors in the central nervous system are reviewed below in relation to the therapeutic targets of marketed melatonin drugs (Table 1).Insomnia, or sleep-wake disorder, is defined as difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep or as nonrestorative sleep and is generally associated with daytime impairment or distress. Melatonin receptor activation decreases neuronal firing through activation of the MT1 receptor in the SCN and areas of the limbic system, which may mediate the sleep-promoting properties of melatonin (9, 14).Activation of melatonin receptors in the SCN plays a pivotal role in coordinating the phase and amplitude of circadian rhythms throughout the body (60). In summary, tasimelteon modulates sleep and circadian rhythms, providing a highly effective treatment for a range of symptoms associated with transmeridian air travel, shift work, and other circadian-rhythm sleep disorders, including those observed in blind people.The melatonin agonists noted above (Table 1) are nonselective at the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptor ligands. Additionally, long-term use leads to unwanted side effects such as sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and a cluster of cognitive, autonomic, and motor signs that constitute the serotonin syndrome (79, 80).
