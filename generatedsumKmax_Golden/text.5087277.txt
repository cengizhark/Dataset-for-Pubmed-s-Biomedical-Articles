Fractions containing protein were pooled and desalted into column buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol) using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Substantially longer BLI experiments were not possible because of sample evaporation. Substantially longer BLI experiments were not possible because of sample evaporation. However, based on differences in affinity, the free energy of ClpP binding by our single-chain ClpX hexamer is far more favorable than ADEP-2B binding.28 Thus, it is unlikely that one ADEP-binding event would be thermodynamically capable of driving the ClpXP complex into a conformation that forces rapid ClpX dissociation.Our results support a “dynamic competition” model in which one ClpX IGF loop transiently unbinds a ClpP cleft, allowing an ADEP to bind and accelerate dissociation by preventing rebinding of the undocked loop (Figure 6b). All AAA+ proteolytic machines must cycle through a variety of nucleotide-dependent conformations as they mechanically unfold and translocate protein substrates. As a consequence, we suspect that the interactions that stabilize these proteolytic machines will also be highly dynamic and influence their mechanisms of assembly and disassembly.
