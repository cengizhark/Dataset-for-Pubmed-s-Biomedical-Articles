The second step of MMR involves recognition of the bound MutSα by a second heterodimer (MLH1:PMS2, also known as MutLα). Because 5-FU is a structural analog of uracil and thymine, many of the enzymes that participate in uracil or thymine metabolism also effectively metabolize 5-FU, topics that have been extensively studied and previously reviewed [10]. The enzyme dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) performs an absolutely essential function to prevent genomic uracil incorporation by catalyzing the hydrolysis of dUTP into dUMP (Figure 2); E. coli and S. cerevisiae lacking dUTPase are inviable [11,12]. Loss of this feedback inhibition presumably increases the conversion of FdUrd to FdUMP by TK and the conversion of FUDP to FdUDP by RNR. Briefly, the UNG genetic locus encodes mitochondrial (UNG1) and nuclear (UNG2) forms of UDGs, with UNG2 appearing to account for the bulk of cellular UDG activity [29]. In this study, both the bacterial and human (presumably UNG2) UDG was found to excise 5-FU, albeit with slightly less efficiency than uracil, from plasmid substrates harboring multiple tritium-labeled base lesions. Most notably, 5-FU is routinely employed in the management of colorectal cancer via one of two FDA-approved first line combinatorial chemotherapy regimes, abbreviated FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, which involve intravenous administration of the fluorinated base analog (Figure 1). cancers characterized by high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) [43], and mutations in the MBD4 gene have been reported in human colorectal cancers found to exhibit MSI-H [44-46].
