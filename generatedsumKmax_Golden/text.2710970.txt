2E,F), whereas the other lines showed less complete, albeit still clear, derepression (Fig. This reporter is expressed throughout the ectoderm and nervous system in late-stage embryos (Muller and Bienz, 1991). We initially tested PRE300-bxd-Ubx-Z inserted at four different chromosomal target sites, two of which were used in a previous study (Bateman et al , 2006) and two others that we developed. Although Pho, as a PcG gene, is known only to be involved in maintaining the repressed state, its ortholog in mammals, YYI, is known to be involved in activation of some target genes (Gordon et al , 2006). In order to test this, the GFP-RR transgene was placed in a phol81A, pho1 double mutant background. In phol81A single mutants, there was no apparent effect (not shown). 5B,E, primer set 8). However, recent studies have blurred the distinction between PcG genes and trxG genes, as some members of each class appear to have dual functions (Grimaud et al , 2006). There are accumulating data suggesting that locus-wide regulation occurs through direct interactions of the promoter with enhancers and locus control regions. RMCE was performed as previously described (Bateman et al , 2006). The attP target lines used were chosen at chromosomal locations that were not suggested to have PREs nearby (Negre et al , 2006; Schwartz et al , 2006; Sinclair et al , 1998; Tolhuis et al , 2006). Homozygous phol larvae were tentatively identified as non-Tubby, and confirmed post hoc by PCR. Homozygous mutant larvae from these lines were identified by their non-Tb phenotype. Dechorionated embryos were crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed and stored at −80°C. The pellets were subjected to ChIP analysis essentially as described previously (Wang et al , 2004b), using Pho-specific antiserum (Brown et al , 1998). 1, compare ‘with Glass’ with ‘without Glass’; note that none of these lines carry a PSE). Among 53 independent lines carrying the Glass vector without the PSE, 43 were homozygous viable and none showed PSS (Fig. 1, ‘with Glass’).We dissected the original 600 bp PSE (+8.6 to +9.2 kb, data not shown) down to an active region of 300 bp (+8.9 to +9.2 kb).
