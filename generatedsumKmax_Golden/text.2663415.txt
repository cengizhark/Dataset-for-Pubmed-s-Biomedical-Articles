Statistical data analysisFor comparison between two groups, ANOVA with post hoc testing was used to statistically analyze data. Elevation of InsP3 concentration to 2 µM increased activity of InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-19Q (Fig 2G, third trace, Fig 2H), but had no additional effect on activity of InsP3R1 co-expressed with ATX3-77Q (Fig 2I, third trace, Fig 2K). Even stronger response to DHPG was observed in MSNs transfected with ATX3-127Q plasmid (Fig 3A, fourth row, Figs 3H and 3I). We discovered that application of 300 nM bradykinin (BK), an agonist of InsP3-coupled receptor, induced much larger Ca2+ responses in hF-SCA3 cells than in control hF cells (Figs 4B, 4C). Obtained results suggested that deranged neuronal Ca2+ signaling plays a significant role in SCA3 pathology; calcium signaling stabilizers may be considered as potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of SCA3 patients. This indicates that dantrolene is neuroprotective and supports the hypothesis that deranged calcium signaling may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SCA3. For off-line computer analysis (pClamp 6, Axon Instruments), currents were filtered digitally at 500 Hz. The microsomes from the RT1:ATX3-19Q and RT1:ATX3-77Q co-infected Sf9 cells were fused to bilayers and the bilayer current recordings and analysis were performed as described above. Following PBS washing 3×10 min, the signals were amplified with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) prepared in PBST and then detected with DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories). Signal was amplified with the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories).
