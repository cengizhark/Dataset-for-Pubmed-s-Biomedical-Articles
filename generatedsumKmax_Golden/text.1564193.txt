Typically, the strength of the illusion as determined from the questionnaire ratings is strongly correlated with errors in the post-exposure pointing responses (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998). At a random point in time between three and seven seconds after the beginning of each trial, the LED flashed either once (for 200 ms), or twice (65 ms ON, 70 ms OFF, and 65 ms ON). ResultsConstant errorIn Experiment 5, unlike Experiments 1 to 4, we also performed an analysis on errors in the front-back (y) direction. Verbal feedback (e.g., “too far left” or “too far right”) was provided on the accuracy of these practice reaches, and the experimenter moved the participants’ finger onto the target for additional feedback. Reaching errors to the left of the target were assigned a positive endpoint error, and errors to the right were assigned negative values. This general bias was similar between visual exposure conditions (real hand = −1.6 ± 0.3 cm, rubber hand = −1.6 ± 0.4 cm, wooden block = −1.5 ± 0.4 cm, where negative values represent endpoints to the right of the target), and is probably attributable to the asymmetrical posture that participants adopted in order to see their hands in the mirror: The participants’ body midline was slightly to the right of the mirror, and unseen reaching movements often show general biases toward the midline (e.g., Ghilardi, Gordon, & Ghez, 1995).
