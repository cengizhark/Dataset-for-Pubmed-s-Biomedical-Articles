Here we successfully characterized HMGB1 as a TLR5 ligand (Figure 1 & 5) and demonstrated HMGB1-induced TLR5 activation is NF-κB-driven (Figure 2 & 3) and releases downstream proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 4) Notably, we also showed that activation of peripheral TLR5 by HMGB1 and flagellin induces pain following subcutaneous administration in rats (Figure 6A & B). Although a few residues of the A- and B-boxes of the HMGB1 tailless mutant show significant chemical shift perturbation, the rest of the residues in these domains are almost structurally identical with the full-length protein (Figure S4A, green labels and Table S1) confirming that the tail region is primarily interacting with the drTLR5 ECD. The Fmoc-protected amino acids (0.5 mmol), HATU (0.5 mmol) and DIPEA (0.5 mmol) in 4 mL DMF were mixed with Rink Amide resin (0.1 mmol) with a substitution level of 0.45 mmol/g for the coupling step. Fluorescence anisotropy assayApparent Kd values were determined by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of 200 nM or 5 µg/ml fluorescein-labeled HMGB1 as a function of increasing concentrations of drTLR5 ECD and MD-2 proteins. Statistical analysisAnimal study: Mechanical allodynia was analyzed as the interpolated 50% thresholds (absolute threshold). Differences between treatment groups were determined by unpaired student’s t-test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. With 30 ug/ml oxPAPC, we observed a significant inhibition of TNF-α secretion upon PAM2- and LPS-mediated TLR2 and TLR4 activation but no effect on flagellin-induced TLR5 stimulation, suggesting the specificity of oxPAPC to TLR2 and TLR4.
