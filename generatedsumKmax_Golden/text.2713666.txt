6b) form a cloud of points that shows a robust negative correlation, suggesting that the difference in CP between congruent and opposite cells may be driven largely by the difference in sensitivity.How does this dependence of bimodal CPs on visual/vestibular congruency arise? 8c, solid curves) for all time windows. However, Fano factor does not differ substantially between congruent and opposite cells (Fig. Hence the difference in sensitivity between congruent and opposite cells arises primarily from differences in the slope of the response function, and these slope changes are well accounted for by linear weighted summation of single-cue responses. Indeed, congruent and opposite cells show comparable linear summation (Fig. 5c), but this produces greater sensitivity for congruent cells and poorer sensitivity for opposite cells. Our current findings show that this relationship holds for both congruent and opposite cells (Suppl. When CPs have been observed previously34,36,38–42, this is the relationship typically seen—stronger firing when the animal reports a preferred stimulus for the neuron. At the end of the 2s trial, the fixation spot disappeared, two choice targets appeared, and the monkey made a saccade to one of the targets to report his perceived motion as leftward or rightward relative to straight ahead (Fig. Note that CI reflects both the congruency of tuning and the steepness of the slopes of the tuning curves around straight ahead. 2c), opposite cells typically became less sensitive (Fig.
