This raises the intriguing possibility that nanoparticles could enter the circulation and produce direct or indirect effects on blood cells, such as monocytes or neutrophils. There was also a time-dependent increase in HIF-1α accumulation in U937 cells exposed to 30 μg/ml of Nano-Ni (Figure 9). Recent studies in humans showed that exposure to nano-sized carbon altered peripheral blood leukocyte distribution and expression of adhesion molecules (Frampton et al  2006). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have clearly shown that exposure to nickel caused HIF-1α accumulation (Salnikow et al  2002, 2003; Davidson et al  2003; Zhao et al  2004). The results suggest that HIF-1α may be involved not only in the regulation of MMPs, but also in the regulation of TIMP-1, which is consistent with previous studies (Haorah et al  2007; Ho et al  2007; Shi et al  2007). These data provide valuable clues to the potential health effects of metal nanoparticle exposure. The microstructure and composition of Nano-Ni and Nano-TiO2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitach H-8000) and ancillary techniques including selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive (X-ray) spectrometry (EDS). Briefly, the specific surface area is 43.8 m2/g for Nano-Ni and 45.0 m2/g for Nano-TiO2. After shaking for 48 h in a water bath at 37° C, the samples were ultrasonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. Chemicals and reagentsMonoclonal mouse anti-human HIF-1α antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) unless otherwise indicated. All chemicals used were of analytic grade. MTS assay is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium compound (MTS) into a formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. Then cells were treated with various concentrations of Nano-Ni or Nano-TiO2 for 24 h. 20 μl of the combined MTS/PMS (phenazine methosulfate) solution was added to each well of the plate. In order to eliminate the potential effects of metal nanoparticles on optical properties, medium with metal nanoparticles at each dose, but without cells were used as background and their A490 readings were subtracted from the experimental groups. cDNA was synthesized from 2.0 μg of total RNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and oligo (dT)18 (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min each time to remove SDS. Then the gels were incubated in development buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% Brij solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 37° C overnight. The membrane was incubated with anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:1000) at 4° C overnight and rinsed with TBST three times. Immunoreactive bands were detected by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) and enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Statistical analyses were carried out using SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Raphael, CA, USA). Cytotoxic effects of Nano-Ni and Nano-TiO2 on U937 cellsU937 cells were exposed to various concentrations of Nano-Ni or Nano-TiO2 for 24 h, and cell viability was measured by both MTS assay and alamarBluetrade; assay as described above.
