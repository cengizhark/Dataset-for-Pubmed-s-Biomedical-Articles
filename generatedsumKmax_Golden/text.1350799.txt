This finding of increased visuotactile extinction when the real hands are viewed in a mirror was examined more thoroughly in a crossmodal congruency task performed by normal human participants (Maravita, Spence, Sergent, & Driver, 2002). Again, this question has been addressed in several ways; first, in neuropsychological patients with dissociations in neglect for near versus far space, and in crossmodal extinction; and second, in normal human participants using the crossmodal congruency task. with severe left visuospatial neglect to bisect lines in near (50 cm from her body) and in far (100 cm) space. This issue of visuospatial versus motor components of neglect needs to be addressed specifically with respect to the use of tools. Second, and more recently, Maravita, Husain, Clarke, and Driver (2001) introduced several further control conditions to examine the factors contributing to the putative modulation of peripersonal space. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the ventral premotor cortex instantiates a multisensory representation of peripersonal space. Somatosensory impulses project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortices (Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, & 3) in the central sulcus and post-central gyrus. Somatosensory impulses project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortices (Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, & 3) in the central sulcus and post-central gyrus. This finding is important to the present discussion, because another group of researchers have come to quite different conclusions regarding the same area’s involvement in the encoding of multisensory peripersonal space.
