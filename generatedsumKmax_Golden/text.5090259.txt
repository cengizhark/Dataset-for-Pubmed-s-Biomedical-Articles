Utilization of opioid medicationsWe followed each patient for 6 weeks following the four procedures to determine 1) the number of patients who filled a prescription for opioid medications (Appendix 2), 2) the type of opioid medication filled, 3) the number of days the opioid was prescribed, 4) the number of refills, and 5) indicators of potentially inappropriate prescription.We used generic drug names to identify prescriptions from the MarketScan files. Guidelines have been established for clinicians who care for patients suffering from chronic pain in order to curb the prescription of opioids and offer algorithms for the use of alternative analgesics.11–13 However, far less is known regarding appropriate prescribing practices following routine elective surgery.14 Inadequately managed perioperative pain causes difficulty with postoperative rehabilitation, prolonged length of stay, and may be associated with the development of chronic post-surgical pain.15–17 Despite their risks, opioids are effective at alleviating postoperative pain, and remain the standard of care for treating moderate to severe acute post-surgical pain.18 Therefore, identifying safe practices for opioid management is an important priority for all surgeons in practice. The MSA describes geographical regions with a relatively high density of population at its core with adjacent communities with similar degree of social and economic factors as the core. Previous studies demonstrate wide variation in analgesic prescribing practices following hand surgery procedures.27,28 Similar to our findings, Rodgers et al  reported that opioid needs were higher among patients who underwent bony-related procedures, and lower among Medicare beneficiaries.28 Although this study was conducted within a single center, the authors noted that nearly two-thirds of the pills in a single prescription went unused, which underscores the need for appropriate prescribing practices to prevent excess opioid medications reaching unintended users. Previous studies have also demonstrated that patients’ psychosocial stressors and coping skills have a significant effect on postoperative pain management.29,30 Furthermore, patients with pre-existing pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, are more likely to consume opioid analgesics following surgery.31,32 Therefore, identifying patients prior to surgery who are expected to require increased doses or prolonged courses of opioid analgesics could help providers tailor their prescribing practices more effectively toward those patients who will derive the greatest benefit with the lowest risk.33
