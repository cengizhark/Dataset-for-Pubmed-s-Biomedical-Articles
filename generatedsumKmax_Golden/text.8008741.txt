Nonhuman primates are similar to humans with respect to reproductive pathophysiology, including maturation, HPG axis regulation of reproductive function, hormone metabolism, and responses to estrogens, progestogens, androgens, and other hormonally active agents. An integrative approach to reproductive system assessments is more informative than histopathology alone and ideally should include baseline confirmation of age and reproductive life stage, in-life assessments of reproductive parameters, serum hormone measurements, and a thorough and consistent gross pathology protocol. In this estrogen-dominant state without the mucous differentiation caused by progesterone, islands of stratified squamous epithelium form under the normal columnar mucous epithelium of the endocervix (Figure 8).113Proliferative lesions of the cervix and vagina most often occur near the squamocolumnar junction or transition zone of the cervix and are usually associated with papillomavirus infection.114 Lesions are focal or multifocal and may be warty and exophytic, plaque-like, or endophytic. Papillomavirus lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.113 In addition to papillomavirus-associated lesions, a condylomatous lesion of the external genitalia has been identified in cynomolgus macaques of Mauritian origin; this lesion is not associated with papillomavirus infection and lacks dysplasia and atypia. In the Yadkin-Pee Dee River basin of North Carolina and South Carolina, principle component analysis identified waterborne PAHs as the contaminants most correlated with intersex occurrence and severity in both Micropterus and Lepomis spp.
