In humans, mutation of either DAP12 or TREM-2 results in PLOSL (also known as Nasu-Hakola syndrome), a rare disease characterized by presenile dementia, bone cysts, and impaired osteoclast differentiation (15, 25, 45). Upon engagement of DAP12-associated receptors, the tyrosine residues in theDAP12 ITAM are phosphorylated, leading to the recruitment and activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Syk and ZAP70,which in turn lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (20). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against mouse YM1 were a gift from G. Krystal, rat antibody against the mannose receptor (5D3) was from L. Martinez-Pomares. The specificity of antibody binding and secondary reagents was monitored through the use of isotype-matched control antibodies (IgG2b for 5C6, IgG1 for DECMA-1). Frozen tissue sections were thawed at room temperature, fixed in 2% PFA in Hepes-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, quenched with glucose oxidase, blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with antibodies against EMR1, CD68, MARCO, and mannose receptor (10 Âµg/ml). Cloning and transfectionMurine DAP12 cDNA was amplified with the following primers: Forward primer AAGCTAGCCCGCCATGGGGGCTCTGGAGCCCTCC, reverse primer AACACACAGAGGCAATATTACCAGTCGACAA and cloned into pEYFP-N1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, US) via the NheI and SalI site. DAP12-deficient mice have been generated either by partial gene deletion (16, 26) or by mutation of the DAP12 gene, leading to expression of a nonfunctional version of the DAP12 protein (27).
