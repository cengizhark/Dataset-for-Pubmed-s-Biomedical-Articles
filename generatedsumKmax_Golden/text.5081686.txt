(2) In addition, there was no significant trend in PFD prevalence over the 5-year period. (3) In examining risk factors for PFDs, older age was the most significant risk factor with over 50% of women over the age of 80 having one or more PFD. (2, 4, 6)Data are mixed regarding the prevalence of UI across racial/ethnic groups. (2, 10, 11*) In the Nursesâ€™ Health Study of more than 64,000 women, the prevalence of dual UI and FI was 7.2%. (13*) Risk factors for dual incontinence include older age, depression, co-morbidities, diarrhea, multiparity, and hysterectomy. (23, 24) After these FDA notices, several studies have evaluated trends in the use of mesh for POP. (23, 24) After these FDA notices, several studies have evaluated trends in the use of mesh for POP. Overall Pelvic Floor DisordersNygaard and colleagues demonstrated the significant public health burden of PFDs in their landmark study in 2008. (39**) Taken together both studies indicate that a significant increase in both the number of women with PFDs and those seeking care for PFDs will occur over the next 20 to 40 years. Pelvic floor disorders are a significant public health issue affecting the lives of millions of adult women. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. As the U.S. population ages over the next 40 years, the burden of PFDs will become greater and the number of surgeries performed for PFDs per year will increase. This increased demand for PFD treatment and care in the future will lead to a greater need for providers properly trained in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, the newest board-certified subspecialty within the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
