shRNA constructs against human TFE3 were generated by annealing oligonucleotides against human TFE3 (corresponding to the sequence of the siRNA described below) into the AgeI and EcoRI sites of pLKO.1-puro vector. Samples were clarified by centrifugation and protein content measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). 30 mg protein was resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Immune complexes were washed and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and western blotting. To clarify homogenates, samples were centrifuged at 20K x g, for 7 minutes at 4°C. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Slides were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a spinning disk confocal system (Perkin Elmer) or a Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 710. Briefly, the tissue was post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, stained En Bloc with uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, infiltrated with propylene oxide/Epon mixtures, embedded in pure Epon, and polymerized over night at 60°C. Thin sections were cut with an LKB 8801 ultramicrotome and diamond knife, stained with lead citrate, and examined in a FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope. One micron sections were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and examined by light microscopy. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the relative amount of cDNA was calculated by the comparative CT method using the 18S ribosomal RNA sequences as a control. Proteins were then precipitated with tricholoracetic acid, resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and 1 M urea and digested first with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) for 17 hours at room temperature and then with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) for 6 hours at 37 °C. The reaction was then quenched by adding 6 μl of 5 % (w/v) hydroxylamine in 200 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and incubation for 15 min at RT.
