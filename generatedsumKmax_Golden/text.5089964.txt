In the management of IDH-mutant gliomas, aggressive surgery targeting all non-enhancing areas of disease remains the standard first-line treatment since, in low grade gliomas (which again are largely IDH mutant), a significant correlation has been demonstrated between maximal tumor resection and overall survival [11]. Long-term follow-up data of the randomized phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9402 [22] and the EORTC trial 26951 [23] demonstrated an improved outcome – in both progression-free and overall survival – in 1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors when procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy (PCV) was added to RT – for instance, in the RTOG 9402 trial the median survival of those with 1p/19q co-deleted tumors treated with PCV plus RT was twice that of patients receiving RT (14.7 v 7.3 years). Accordingly, IDH status was prognostic but not predictive in the retrospective analysis of the German Glioma Network NOA-04 trial, in which patients with anaplastic gliomas were randomized to receive first either RT or CT (PCV or temozolomide) and upon disease progression to receive the other treatment modality [24]. Hence, no statements can be made about the predictive implication of molecular markers in this patient group.
