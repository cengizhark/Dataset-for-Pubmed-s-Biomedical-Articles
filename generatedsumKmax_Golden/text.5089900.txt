Finally, we excluded patients who were discharged within one day of urine culture collection, so our findings do not reflect the burden of antibiotic usage for ASB in the outpatient setting. Criteria for inclusion for chart review were: age ≥ 18 years, an inpatient stay >1 calendar day, and a urine culture with >103 colony forming units. Medical record review was conducted by clinicians (physicians at 2 hospitals, pharmacists at one) using a standardized data abstraction tool and entered into an electronic database (REDCap version 5.6.0). Physician documentation was reviewed to assess for UTI symptoms (Table 1) and concurrent conditions that may contribute to symptoms. Antibiotic treatment both at day 1 and at day 4 after urine culture collection was assessed. An assessment of inter-rater reliability was performed at each hospital; 5% of data collected was reviewed by co-investigators experienced in medical record review, and overall agreement was 96%. Forty-four percent (133/300) of patients with bacteriuria were on antibiotics for a non-urinary source on day 1 following urine culture collection. The most frequent organism isolated from urine culture was Escherichia coli (n=119), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=36), Enterococcus spp. Of the 212 patients with ASB, and after excluding 48 patients on antibiotics for both UTI and non-UTI indications, the proportion of patients with ASB that received antibiotics for positive urine culture was 38% (62/164) at one day after urine culture collection. In bivariate analysis, variables associated with ASB treatment were hospital identity (Hospital C vs. Hospital A, OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14–0.80, p=0.01), presence of leukocyte esterase (OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.35–12.79, p<0.01), positive nitrite (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.11–5.41, p=0.03), elevated mean urine leukocyte count (65 versus 24 white blood cells per high-powered field, p<0.01), and the presence of E. coli as the primary urine pathogen (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.7, p=0.01). The proportion of patients treated with antibiotics for ASB did not change from day 1 to day 4 following urine culture, a time by which most urine cultures would have been finalized. Dalen et al  observed ciprofloxacin to be the most common antibiotic used in 15 cases of overtreatment for ASB (33%), and Werner et al  identified that among all inpatient fluoroquinolone use, 30% was for ASB.11,22 Likewise, we observed broad-spectrum antibiotics comprise a substantial proportion of ASB treatment, thereby potentially contributing to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, and increased rates of C. difficile infection.8 The latter is of particular concern, given older age is an established risk factor for C. difficile infection, and our median patient age was 67 years.23 We did not observe a significant association between presence of multi-drug resistant urinary pathogens and risk for treatment of ASB, though we were underpowered to test this association. Educational efforts using infectious diseases specialists have been shown to reduce the incidence of inappropriate ASB treatment.26 Our observations suggest that infectious disease specialists are only involved in a small proportion of patients with ASB (8%, 14/164), thus limiting the opportunity to impact overall hospital antibiotic usage. Additionally, bivariate analysis found only results of urine studies, and not patient-specific variables such as age or presence of a catheter, were associated with antibiotic treatment for ASB.
