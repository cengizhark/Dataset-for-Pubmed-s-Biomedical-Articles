It has been shown in experimental settings that tracking faster and faster periodic inputs leads to a regime where subjects skip cycles because they are unable to keep up. Our modeling framework provides us with an explicit dependence of the emergence of undesirable phenomena (skipped cycles) as a function of q, the parameter that directly dictates the density of spikes (neural computing), the musculoskeletal system M, and cerebrocerebellar dynamics K. Specifically, we show that for a fixed musculoskeletal system M, cerebrocerebellar dynamics K, and a pair of motor neurons with thresholds q (for activation of agonist/antagonist pair of muscles), the oscillation input (periodic back-and-forth movement) with frequency ω may generate undesired skipped cycles if ω is too large and/or the density of spikes (related to q) is too small. For example, if you insert a high-frequency periodic input into a linear model, the same frequency appears at the output but is likely attenuated. Specifically, we show that for a fixed musculoskeletal system M, cerebrocerebellar dynamics K, and a group of motor neurons with spiking thresholds q (for activation of agonist/antagonist pair of muscles), the oscillatory input (periodic back-and-forth movement) with frequency ω may generate undesired skipped cycles if ω > ωc(M, K, q). Consequently, we maintain the spiking or pulsatile nature of alpha motor neuron control of muscles by modeling them with IAF models, which have been used to model motor neurons in both experimental and computational studies (Goroso, Cisi, & Kohn, 2000; Cofer et al , 2010).For each joint in our muscle model described in section 2.2, we characterize an effective agonist group of motor units and an effective antagonist group of motor units. when v (t) > q, a weighted positive spike, qδ (t), is produced. In this section, we first demonstrate how our closed-loop SCS model qualitatively reproduces fundamental properties of alpha motor neuron activity and musculoskeletal responses during movement generation. The model reproduces spiking patterns during slow periodic movements, as shown in Figure 4c, in fact also capturing the discontinuities during slow movements.The SCS model also reproduces movement responses to some elemental reference inputs in both health and cerebellar disease.
