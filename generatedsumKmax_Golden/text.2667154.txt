Physiological evidence has yet to be provided at the single-cell level. A plausible hypothesis is that the pre-SMA switch signal is implemented by the STN, through direct connections from the pre-SMA to the STN (Inase et al , 1999). Indeed, the STN has been suggested to play a role in the switching of movement (Monchi et al , 2006), yet the detailed underlying mechanism is unknown. The present study and our previous study (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007) show that both the STN and pre-SMA contain switch neurons. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the switch signal in the STN originates from the pre-SMA rather than the STN influencing the pre-SMA through output nuclei of the basal ganglia and the thalamus (Alexander et al , 1986). Behavioral tasksDuring experimental sessions, the monkey was placed in a sound-attenuated room and seated in a primate chair with its head immobilized. The electrode was driven by a hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-97A; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) through a stainless steel guide tube, which was used to penetrate the dura and was held in place by a grid that was fixed inside the recording chamber (Crist et al , 1988). The head then was fixed to the stereotaxic device, and the brain was cut into blocks in the coronal plane parallel to the electrode penetrations. Frozen sections were cut every 50 Î¼m using a microtome and were stained for Nissl using thionin.
