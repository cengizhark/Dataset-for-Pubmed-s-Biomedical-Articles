For this reason, innate immune system receptors are believed to recognise a far lower diversity of molecules than MHC molecules or immunoglobulins. It is therefore of interest to compare the molecular evolution of innate immune system molecules that bind directly to pathogens with the patterns observed in MHC and immunoglobulin molecules. We assumed that in D. simulans N = 2 Ã— 106 and in D. melanogaster N = 106 (Andolfatto and Przeworski 2000). Previous studies on the molecular evolution of two families of Drosophila immune receptors have produced contrasting results. However, we did look for variation within each of the genes, and in TepII the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio was significantly heterogeneous using both the D. simulans and the D. melanogaster datasets (D. melanogaster, mean G=15.4 [p<0.001], number of runs=183 [p=0.006], K-S=0.03 [p=0.03]; D. simulans, mean G=6.49 [p<0.03], number of runs=235 [p=0.22], K-S=0.04 [p=0.001]). Vertebrate immune system receptors such as MHC molecules and immunoglobulins are very specific in the parasite-derived epitopes that they bind to. Only about 0.2% of the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster has occurred since the split of European and African populations (David and Capy 1988; Lachaise et al  1988). This study combined with previous work means that the molecular evolution of four different classes of molecules that bind to the surface of pathogens and illicit an immune response have been studied. Similar explanations have been proposed to account for the rapid evolution of other Drosophila immune system molecules (Begun and Whitley 2000).The evolution of GNBPs has been examined in both termites and Daphnia (Bulmer and Crozier 2005; Little et al  2004). For this reason we only used inversion-free chromosomes for sequencing. In the sample from Gabon, 8 of 21 2L chromosome arms had inversions, and 10 inversion-free lines were retained for sequencing. In the Netherlands lines, all 16 of the 3L chromosome arms inspected were inversion-free, and 12 of these were retained for sequencing. Of 14 Netherlands 2R chromosome arms inspected, 13 were inversion-free. Despite this limitation, the innate immune response can recognise and eliminate a broad array of pathogens and parasites.
