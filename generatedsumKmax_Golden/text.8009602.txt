In the ADJUNCT ONE trial, those with detectable C-peptide at baseline had improved responses to liraglutide compared to those without.12 In an earlier study, we analysed the acute metabolic effects of exenatide in patients with T1D during mixed-meal tolerance tests and observed a marked improvement in glucose excursion in response to oral but not to intravenous glucose.15 In those with residual insulin production, there was a relative increase in insulin secreted in response to glucose, most likely related to the reduced glucose excursion because the total amount of insulin secreted did not change with exenatide. They were screened for detectable levels of C-peptide in response to a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT), performed with a liquid meal (Boost) using described methods16: 33 patients had a level during the test of ≥0.017 nmol/L and 46 had levels <0.017 nmol/L (0.05 ng/mL), the lower limit of detection in the C-peptide assay (Figure 1, Table S1). Prespecified secondary outcomes at 24 weeks included: change in weight; change in total daily insulin dose; C-peptide and glucose responses during the MMTTs; frequency of hypoglycaemia; and other adverse events, with a comparison within and between patients with and without detectable C-peptide at entry.The original target sample size calculation was based on repeated measures of HbA1c in patients with T1D in our clinic in which the standard deviation (SD) of the HbA1c level was 1.25% and the correlation between measurements of HbA1c, performed 24 weeks apart, was 0.88. A linear model compared the least squares (LS) means of exenatide ER to placebo at 24 weeks between groups at the two-sided 0.05 significance level. Linear mixed effect models similar to those described above were used to evaluate continuous secondary outcomes. Many patients, even those with long-standing T1D, may have detectable levels of C-peptide well beyond the new-onset period.6,7 Tropic effects of exendin-4 on β cells were shown in rodents after partial pancreatectomy, and synergy with immune therapy at the time of diabetes onset enhanced the insulin content of β cells.8,9 Data from human studies have identified impaired function of residual β cells in patients with T1D, thus further supporting a potential use of GLP-1RAs in these patients.10 In the observational follow-up at week 52, 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation, the HbA1c level increased in the exenatide ER group to the pretreatment levels.The decline in HbA1c at 12 weeks was largely driven by those with detectable C-peptide (mean −0.51% [95% CI −0.827, −0.184]; P = 0.0025 vs. baseline) versus those without detectable C-peptide (mean −0.143% [95% CI −0.447, 0.162]), but the differences between those with and without detectable C-peptide were not statistically significant at that time (mean 0.363 [95% CI −0.08, 0.806]; P = 0.107) or at 24 weeks (mean −0.101% [95% CI −0.68, 0.479]; P = 0.73 [Figure 2B]). In the ADJUNCT ONE study, liraglutide, administered once daily at three dosing levels, added to insulin therapy in patients with T1D, reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, total daily insulin dose and body weight but increased the rates of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia with ketosis.12 Similar data were reported in the ADJUNCT TWO study, evaluating 1.2 or 1.8 mg/d of liraglutide added to capped insulin therapy.13 Recently, short-acting exenatide did not improve HbA1c levels when given for 26 weeks as add-on therapy to insulin-treated patients with T1D.14 There were no significant differences between the treatment groups on other organ class-specific adverse events, nor on grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events during the off study drug phase.There were a total of eight serious adverse events, six in the exenatide ER arm while taking study drug and two in the placebo group.
