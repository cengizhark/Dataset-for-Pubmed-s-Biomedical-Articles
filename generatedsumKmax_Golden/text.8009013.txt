The fraction corresponding to radiolabeled product was collected and the activity was measured (this activity was denoted by β) and the time was recorded. The decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) was obtained by dividing the decay-corrected β by α. At the outset, it was determined that 427 nm LEDs were interchangeable with 455 nm LEDs (See Supplementary Table 1), and most of the optimization was performed with 455 nm LEDs due to their higher commercial availability. We hypothesize that the excess TBAHCO3 helps to minimize the decomposition of [18F]TBAF via Hofmann elimination and buffers the system to a basic pH, which has been shown to improve [18F]fluoride nucleophilicity.36 In the absence of TBAHCO3, a significant drop in yield was observed (entry 2). Since [18F]TBAF is usually synthesized with minimal H2O present,4 our results suggest that t-BuOH is forming beneficial adducts with [18F]TBAF30 and that excessive water mitigates 18F− nucleophilicity, which mirrors the drop in 19F-deoxyfluorination when H2O concentration increases. Thus, we were surprised to see that significant product formation (62.7% RCY) occurs after only 2 minutes and displays yield growth until 20 min (Extended Data Figure 1). Nucleofuge scope for deoxyradiofluorination beyond 4-chlorophenoxy ethers.While the 4-chlorophenoxy group is the optimal nucleofuge for our system, it is important to note that other electron-poor aryloxy groups explored earlier are also compatible with our radiofluorination method (Figure 5). Substrate scope for CRA-SNAr with 18F.While the success of our 19F−-fluorination method appears to be substrate-dependent, greater generality is observed for radiofluorination (Figure 6) as the 18F-labeled congeners are isolated with moderate to excellent RCY. This result is complementary to existing routes involving spirocylic hypervalent iodoniums40 or stoichiometric aryl nickel complexes34, and enables facile production of [18F]35–1.
