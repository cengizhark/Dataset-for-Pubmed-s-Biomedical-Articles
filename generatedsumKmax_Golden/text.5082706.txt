Additionally, leukemias and lymphomas are often transplantable and amenable to manipulation in culture, making this a potentially powerful system to assess the role of cellular aneuploidy in tumorigenesis in the future without requiring repeated isolations of trisomic fetal liver cells. Taken together, HSCs provide a tractable cellular system to study the effects of aneuploidy in vivo for several reasons. Because we are particularly interested in evaluating the effects of aneuploidy on cellular fitness in vivo, we sought to utilize this transplantation system in particular to study trisomic HSCs. Backcrossing the Robertsonian strains into an inbred line both reduces lethality due to histoincompatibility and ensures the phenotypes observed are due to differences in the donor HSCs and not a consequence of delayed graft rejection in the recipients. Timed matings were employed to harvest trisomic embryos at E13.5 or E14.5, when HSCs could be readily isolated from fetal livers.
