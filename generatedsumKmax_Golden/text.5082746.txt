The current study focuses on the topical delivery of pure 1 and P. barbatus extract on guinea pig and human skin to determine the skin disposition and rates of transport of 1. An in vitro skin diffusion study of pure forskolin (1) versus P. barbatus extract in hairless guinea pig skin and human skin in a flow-through diffusion cell system was conducted. In this study, the diffusion of forskolin was quantified by LC-MS. Representative profiles of the in vitro permeation study of human skin and guinea pig skin treated with pure 1 and P. barbatus extract are shown in Figure 1. Skin sections were obtained by using a Padgett dermatome (Integra LifeSciences Corporation; Plainsboro, NJ) set to 250 μm; these sections were stored at −20 °C. Samples were collected in 3 h increments for 24 h. All samples were stored at 4 °C, until analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV and cone voltage set at 25 V, where the source block temperature and desolvation temperature were 120 and 250 °C, respectively. The gradient elution mobile phase initially consisted of 45% A:55% B. The initial 45% mobile phase A was increased linearly to 62% over 10 min, maintained for 1 min, and then decreased linearly to 45% in 1 min and maintained for 8 min.
