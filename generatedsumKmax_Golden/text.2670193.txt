In this series we used low stimulation intensities (0.05–0.3 mA) because we wanted to concentrate on modulation by quinpirole. Following dye loading, cortical re-stimulation resulted in exocytosis of FM1-43 dye from the terminals, which decreased in a manner approximated by a single exponent, characteristic of synaptic vesicle fusion (Figs. AnimalsMice were obtained from the University of British Columbia or from the breeding colony at UCLA. Biphasic alterations in biophysical membrane properties and postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated currentsIn order to more specifically examine postsynaptic changes in AMPAR function, we assessed changes in evoked currents in acutely dissociated MSNs at 1 and 7 months. At 12 months, the synaptic response amplitude in YAC128 MSNs remained depressed. Brains were dissected and sliced in the coronal plane (350 μm thick) in oxygenated ice-cold low-Ca2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 glucose. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier in concert with Clampex acquisition software (v8.1). Evoked AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV in ACSF containing 10 μM bicuculline (BIC, a GABAA receptor antagonist). Coronal sections (200 μm thick) containing cortex and striatum were cut on a vibratome and allowed to recover for 1 h in carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ACSF solution: (in mM) 109 NaCl, 5 KCl, 35 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaHPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES acid and 10 glucose at room temperature. For whole cell voltage clamp recordings, the internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 175 N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 40 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 10 ethylene glycol-bis (-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 12 phosphocreatine, 2 Na2ATP, 0.2 Na2GTP, and 0.1 leupeptin (pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mOsm, Sigma Chemicals). Analyses were performed with Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), Statistica 6.1 (Tulsa, OK), SigmaStat (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software suites. At 1 month, the mean peak response amplitudes were significantly greater in cells from YAC128 mice compared to those of WTs at stimulation intensities between 0.3–1.0 mA (Figs.
