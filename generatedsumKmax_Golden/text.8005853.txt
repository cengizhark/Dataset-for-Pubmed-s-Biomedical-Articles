Human neuroimaging studies have shown that viewing pictures of appetizing foods can lead to activation close to this region (Simmons et al , 2005). Parametric analysis of neural areas whose activity varied systematically with these two ratings showed that a part of the right insular cortex decreased in activity with increasing ratings of both attractiveness and moral goodness. In addition, we observed surprisingly little convergence of ALE foci across the individual gustation and olfaction analyses, despite strong expectations in the literature for such a convergence for flavor processing. Finally, Zald et al  (2002) found medial OFC activation for the consumption of both pleasant (sugar) and aversive (quinine) solutions, with no mediolateral differences across valence. Finally, we include the ventral basal ganglia in this circuit, which are considered to be among the “hedonic hotspots” of the brain (Berridge et al , 2009). Four of the six studies of musical pleasantness did (Blood and Zatorre, 2001; Brown et al , 2004; Koelsch et al , 2006; Menon and Levitin, 2005), while only one of the five studies of visual artworks did (Di Dio et al , 2007).
