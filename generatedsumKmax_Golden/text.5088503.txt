Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) protocol #9981. Samples were removed from the sucrose min in 10% bovine serum albumin with 5% horse serum followed by incubation with arrays, median centering of genes, and sum of squares = 1 normalization for both selection divided by the number of pixels) for the entire image was calculated
