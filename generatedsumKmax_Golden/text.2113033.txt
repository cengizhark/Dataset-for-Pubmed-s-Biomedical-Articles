siRNA oligonucleotides (Ambion) were made to the following sequences (sense-strand):Mcm5-1i: 5'-GGAGGUAGCUGAUGAGGUGTT-3'Mcm5-2i: 5'-GGAUCUGGCCAGCUUUGAUTT-3'Chk1: 5'-AAGCAGUCGCAGUGAAGAUUG-3' (Rocha et al  2005)Control unrelated oligo was purchased from Dharmacon. Caffeine was used at 5 mM to inhibit checkpoint signalling. After a second 5 min spin at 5000g, the resultant pellet containing chromatin-bound sample was washed with CSK buffer for three times and suspended in 100 μl Nupage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, supplemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). FACSBrdU-7AAD double labelling was performed as described (Ekholm-Reed et al  2004). Cells continue to synthesise DNA normally when the level of Mcm2-7 is reduced (Cortez et al  2004; Tsao et al  2004) and in Xenopus egg extracts normal replication rates are maintained when Mcm2-7 levels are reduced to ∼2 per origin (Mahbubani et al  1997; Edwards et al  2002; Oehlmann et al  2004; Woodward et al  2006). Biotin-11-dUTP was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone BN-34; Sigma; 1:1000 dilution) and appropriate Cy3 conjugated second antibody. To confirm our conclusions, we therefore used a double-labelling strategy as shown in Figure 1D. Similar results were obtained when checkpoint kinases were inhibited using the caffeine, an ATM/ATR inhibitor (Supplementary Fig S3B). We therefore used siRNAs targeting different regions of MCM5 mRNA to knock down MCM5 expression in U2OS cells. We therefore used siRNAs targeting different regions of MCM5 mRNA to knock down MCM5 expression in U2OS cells. siRNAs were titrated to find the maximum concentration that maintained normal proliferation rates. Figs 3E and 3F show that treatment of cells with MCM5-2i siRNA suppressed the ability of cells to reduce replication fork spacing when checkpoint kinases were inhibited by Chk1 siRNA or caffeine.
