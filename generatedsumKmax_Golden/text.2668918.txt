Nuclear staining was also identified in some cases (Fig. Absent or weak staining was seen in more than 95% of the normal epithelial tissues (Fig. As will be shown below, the S629A mutation blocks phosphorylation of GGAP2 by Akt and also significantly downregulates GTPase activity. 4C), indicating that Akt phosphorylation of GGAP2 enhances GTP binding, presumably by downregulating the GTPase activity of the GAP domain. AKT-GGAP2 stimulates transcriptional activation of NF-κBNF-κB is a transcription factor and the promoter regions of many genes contain NF-kB binding sites. A novel group of positive regulators of the PI3-K pathway are the PIKE/GGAP2 proteins (19-26). In the presence of S629 phosphorylated GGAP2, the transcriptional activity of NK-κB is significantly increased, perhaps by direct interaction with the protein in the nucleus, or by enhancing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB or both. It has been shown that Akt may directly interact with IKK to enhance its activity (41). The GGAP2 protein is similar to PIKE-L except the N-terminal proline-rich domains due to an alternative promoter. This binding enhances Akt activation while a dominant negative form of GGAP2 decreases Akt activity. In summary, GGAP2 can promote Akt activity via direct binding with the protein, which can be modulated by GTP binding. The staining index for each case was then calculated by multiplying the average intensity score for the three cores by the average percentage score for the three cores, yielding a 10 point tumor staining index ranging from 0 (no staining) to 9 (extensive, strong staining) for each case.
