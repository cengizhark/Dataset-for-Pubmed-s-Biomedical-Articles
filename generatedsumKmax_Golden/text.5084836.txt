Most have focused specifically on changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Using the BUAL method in rat, the methylation status of DNA within pancreatic islets of IUGR offspring was determined. Although smoking per se did not affect global methylation, a significant correlation between paternal DNA methylation and that of the offspring was lost if either the father or offspring ever smoked. Global DNA methylation status in newborn cord blood is associated with cord blood serum cotinine levels (68). Global DNA methylation levels were lowest in newborns with the highest serum cotinine levels. Women who quit smoking during pregnancy have infants who weigh more than those who continue to smoke, and also have an increased likelihood of having infants who weigh the same when compared to women who never smoked (11). In addition to preterm birth, smoking has been linked to preterm premature rupture of membranes (preterm PROM). When comparing non smoking mothers with the AA genotypes of CYP1A1 and the GSTT1 present allele to smoking mothers with either Aa or aa CYP1A1 and GSTT1 (null) there is also a significant association with pre term delivery and lower gestational age (38, 39).
