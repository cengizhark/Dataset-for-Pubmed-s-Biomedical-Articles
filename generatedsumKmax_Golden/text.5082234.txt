Furthermore, to minimize any presynaptic effects of TEA, we included picrotoxin (PTX) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) to block GABAA and ionotropic glutamate receptors, respectively, in both control conditions and during TEA incubation.Incubation of cerebellar slices with actinomycin D (25 μM + PTX + KYNA) alone for 3 hrs did not alter the I-V relationship of EPSCs or the distance-dependent increase in rectification index (Fig. A stronger inward rectification and more rapid decay time of EPSCs suggest an increase in GluA2-lacking receptors at 40–60 μm following TEA treatment. Following incubation of cerebellar slices with cycloheximide for 3 hrs we observed no gradient in the rectification index of EPSCs along dendrites. Synapses that showed stronger inward rectification at the beginning of recording also had a greater increase in rectification index (Fig. Thus, the increase in EPSC rectification index is unlikely to result from an increase in a TARP-AMPAR association.This result together with the two opposing effects on the dendritic GluA2 gradient by TEA and an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker (Fig. A second protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (40 μM), also prevented the increase in rectification index (0.33 ± 0.04, n = 5; P < 0.0005) that was induced by TTX treatment (suppl. Patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM): K-methylsulphonate 130, HEPES 10, NaCl 4, Mg2ATP 4, Tris2GTP 0.3, phosphocreatine 14, and Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) hexapotassium salt 0.1; the resistance of the electrodes was 4–6 MΩ. A full list of antibodies, staining conditions, and image acquisition and analysis is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, or Student’s t tests (paired, unpaired two-tailed or one sample) as appropriate if a data set passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for comparison of cumulative distribution plots.
