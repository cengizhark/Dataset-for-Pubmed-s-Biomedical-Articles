While TGF-β signaling does regulate the expression of EcR-B1 within MB γ neurons, the precise temporal regulation is achieved by the systemic release of the steroid hormone ecdysone, which in turn modulates the activity of EcR-B1. Moreover, the current data is still consistent with two main models – in one, the UPS is required to target a key molecule whose degradation initiates pruning; in the second, the UPS targets many proteins whose SUM degradation results in pruning. Interestingly, the TGF-β pathway was recently found to regulate neuronal C1q expression, which in turn is important for synaptic elimination by microglia at the developing mouse dLGN [136]. The elimination of these exuberant connections is largely timed to postnatal development in vertebrates but the precise timing varies among organisms [7].
