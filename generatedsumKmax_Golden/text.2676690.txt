Monkeys were required to reach criterion on each of three consecutive sessions with the visual barrier before each test session. Monkeys moved on to the main task if they performed at criterion level (21 out of 24 correct) with the 2-s delay for each of three consecutive days.Main taskThe main task was conducted as in Experiment 1 with the exception that the tray was already at the lowest height. Future studies of memory awareness might benefit from manipulating the benefit of the food rather than the cost of looking, either through the number or quality of rewards or the hunger of the subject. Non-metacognitive accountsThe inference of memory awareness is valid only if capuchins base their search strategy on judgments about the contents of their own memory. While this could suggest a search for more information (e.g., an exhaustive search), it could also suggest that, in capuchins, the reaching response is weak compared to the searching response under these testing conditions. Nonetheless, the positive results from Experiment 2 are consistent with the existence of memory awareness in capuchins. To determine when memory awareness evolved, it would be useful to study additional primate species, especially New World monkeys. On each trial, they could either seek more information by searching the four tubes or choose a tube without looking. Each tube attached via a hinge near the front of the tray such that it could be pulled up like a lever, causing any food inside to roll out toward the monkey. The tray on which the tubes were mounted could be placed at one of five different heights. Determining the extent to which nonhuman animals are aware of their knowledge will inform research into when and why memory awareness might have evolved and research into what aspects of cognition we share with other animals.
