ERβ activation in ER− breast cancer stem cells (BSCs) increased mammosphere growth, and ERβ knockdown with shRNA in TNBC xenografts reduced tumor volume by 50%. The role of estrogens in suppressing androgenic actions (through the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and negative luteinizing hormone feedback) in PCa has been noted for over 70 years [39]. Further epidemiological evidence indicates that the ratio of circulating testosterone to E2 is significant to the progression of PCa; low testosterone and/or high E2 was associated with higher risk of PCa. ERβ activation in the prostate is typically tumor suppressive, with ERβ agonists displaying anti-proliferative activity in cell and mouse models of prostate cancer [45,46]. In vitro models have also shown that ERβ2 can upregulate several proteins associated with osteolytic metastasis [53]. Secreted neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are highly expressed in granule and Purkinje cells and may be involved in mediating the expression of ERβ during cerebellar development [55].
