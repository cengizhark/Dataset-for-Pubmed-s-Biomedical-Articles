Using rat cortex lysates, antibodies against NKA α1, but not α3 or β subunits, co-immunoprecipitated AMPARs (Figure 1E), indicating a specific association of NKA α1 subunit with AMPARs. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first inhibited protein synthesis. 6E), indicating that AMPARs are first endocytosed, then sorted for proteolysis. NKA inhibition induces long-lasting depression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmissionWe found that NKA inhibition induces a reduction of surface-localized AMPARs. The molecular mechanisms that serve the synaptic localization of NKA are not clear, but is could be achieved by interaction of NKA with synaptic molecules including PSD scaffolding proteins or glutamate receptors. Given the importance of the sodium gradient for proper functioning of ion channels including glutamate receptors, a functional coupling of NKA and ionotropic glutamate receptors is presumably a necessary cellular device for synapse physiology. Alternatively, sodium accumulation may induce calcium release from intracellular stores, which then subsequently leads to receptor degradation. Fluorescence intensity at the soma was measured at different time points using Image-J and normalized to the starting value. Because AMPARs, the primary mediator of excitatory synaptic transmission, are a major contributor of intraspinal sodium transients, we reasoned that NKA should be intimately positioned with AMPARs in order to facilitate local sodium homeostasis.
