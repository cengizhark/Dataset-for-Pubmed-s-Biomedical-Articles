Combined with numerous other studies finding it to be an independent predictor of mortality,9,13,15,16,19,21,28-31 age represents a robust prognosticator that clinicians can easily use at the bedside. Although various consensus documents and expert panels highlight advanced age as a relative contraindication to ECMO,5,34,35 our study provides granularity to this recommendation and can help to inform future guidelines. Indication for ECMO was identified and grouped into the following 6 categories.HTx/primary graft dysfunction includes patients who had a history of HTx with acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection, or primary graft dysfunction.Postcardiotomy identifies patients with persistent circulatory failure postcardiotomy.Myocardial infarction includes patients with shock in the setting of acute coronary syndrome.Cardiomyopathy includes patients with acute heart failure due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, acute myocarditis, chronic HTx rejection, or patients with cardiac arrest.Other cardiogenic shock encompassed patients not included in the above causes of cardiogenic shock, including those with ventricular arrhythmias.Noncardiogenic shock primarily encompassed patients with mixed shock (both vasodilatory and obstructive), sepsis, and respiratory failure. Patients were primarily cannulated in the operating room (49.9%) or intensive care unit (23.8%), with a minority cannulated in the catheterization laboratory (5.0%) or emergency department (0.3%). Patients had a median intensive care unit length of stay of 13 days (IQR 5–26 days) and hospital length of stay of 19 days (IQR 5–39 days) (Supplementary Fig. For patients who survived to decannulation but died during hospitalization, median time of ECMO support was 5 days (IQR 3–9 days) and median time of hospitalization was 23 days (IQR 14–39 days) (Supplementary Fig. ComplicationsDespite receiving care at high-volume centers with expertise in management of ECMO, our cohort had a high incidence of complications occurring during ECMO support or the remainder of the hospitalization, including acute renal dysfunction (45%), major bleeding (41%), and infection (33%). OutcomesIn our cohort, 60% of patients (n = 433) died during hospitalization, consistent with prior reports.9,14,17,24 Data from a large, international registry of more than 300 ECMO centers, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, demonstrated a 41% survival to discharge for patients who had ECMO initiated for cardiac etiologies.4 This survival rate is similar to that found in an analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, where 43.3% of patients treated with ECMO between 2007 and 2014 survived to discharge.25 In that study, 3.5% of patients were bridged to LVAD, similar to a recent analysis of the Society for Thoracic Surgeons database, which demonstrates that, of 19,825 patients receiving durable MCS between January 2008 and December 2017, only 933 patients (4.7%) were bridged via ECMO.26 Compared with other critically ill patients (Interagency for Mechanical Circulatory Support profile 1), patients requiring ECMO had an inferior 12-month survival, although a high hazard for death occurred in the first 6 months after MCS implantation. Duke Clinical Research Institute served as the data coordinating and statistical analysis center. A possible explanation is that mechanical ventilation may be representative of a more controlled setting for ECMO initiation (in the cardiac intensive care unit for a patient with slowly worsening shock) as opposed to more emergent initiation (out-of-hospital cardiac arrest), which may occur before or during intubation.
