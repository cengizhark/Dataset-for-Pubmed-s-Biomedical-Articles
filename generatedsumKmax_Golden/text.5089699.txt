Reactive oxygen species are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and may arise from various sources such as mitochondrial electron transport, and oxidative enzymes.7 Reactive oxygen species are particularly important in innate immunity and are produced by activated neutrophils as defense mechanisms against extracellular pathogens. To determine if increased IL-17 is pathophysiologically relevant in PE, Dhillon et al  examined the effect of IL-17 infusion on blood pressure via mediation by oxidative stress and production of the angiotensin II type I receptor autoantibody (AT1-AA).36 In this study, IL-17 infusion into normal pregnant rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), increased oxidative stress as measured by urinary isoprostane and NADPH-stimulated placental reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in the population of circulating TH17 cells, and production of AT1-AA. The only effective treatment for abatement of maternal symptoms is delivery of the placenta and fetus. In early pregnancy, the placenta is initially characterized as a hypoxic environment.
