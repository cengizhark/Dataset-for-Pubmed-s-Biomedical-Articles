Importantly, salsolinol can be synthesized endogenously in dopaminergic neurons of mammals including humans [57]. The presence of 44 was confirmed by comparison of retention times and fragmentation pattern with the authentic standard (Fig. Which cyclization pathway will predominate depends both on the experimental conditions and on the type of aldehyde. 2.12, the fragmentation pattern of Î±-N-feruloyl/isoferuloyl arginine (47, 48) is dominated by fragment ions of m/z 177, 149, 145, 117, and 89 originating from the ferulic/isoferulic acid portion of the amide. The first is that amides of isoferulic acid tend to produce less of the secondary fragment ions (m/z 149, 145 and 117) originating from elimination of small neutrals (H2O, MeOH, and CO) from the primary acylium ion (m/z 177) (compare Fig. Although mass spectrometry cannot distinguish between the cis and trans configurations of the double bonds in these compounds, based on co-elution with the synthetic standards the configuration was determined to be trans in all cases. This observation can be explained by a lack of readily available acidic hydrogen that needs to be transferred to the amine during fragmentation. Another benefit of the basic nitrogen is that molecular species observed upon electrospray ionization are typically protonated molecules. A molecular formula with three or more nitrogens is a strong indicator for the presence of a guanidino group, as there are few other possibilities that can account for so many nitrogens in the molecule, particularly if the molecular mass is modest (<400 Da).
