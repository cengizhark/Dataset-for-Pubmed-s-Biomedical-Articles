When tested in compartmented cultures, this dominant inhibitory construct decreases sensory neuronal survival as assessed by an increase in apoptosis (Figure 3E). Both bcl-w and mef2d induction require Trk activation, and so are prevented by K252A, an inhibitor of Trk kinase activity; Trk kinase activity is also required for induction of c-fos (Figure 4C). This may include other promoter elements; for example two sites that resemble half of a CRE binding motif are also present in the bcl-w promoter region (−9871 to−9867 and 2048 to 2052, TGACG). These mice are viable, but males are infertile due to apoptosis in the developing testes (Print et al , 1998; Ross et al , 1998). plenti-hU6BX RNAi plasmids and TK-pRL were from Cellogenetics (Baltimore, MD) and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. MEF2D 6066 (1:1000 for Western blot and 1:100 for immunostaining) was developed in the Greenberg lab, and generated by injecting antigen (a fragment of MEF2D protein, amino acids 292-514; see Han et al , 1995) into rabbit. Characterization and specificity of this antibody are shown in Supplemental Figure 2. Tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX for 10 minutes and blocked in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% TritonX for 60 minutes. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in MEF2D 6066 (1:100) followed by incubation in goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1000) for one hour at room temperature. Neurons were harvested and protein levels of MEF2D were analyzed by Western blot. For in vivo analysis, condensed nuclei using DAPI (1:1000) were counted from post-natal day 0 (P0) bcl-w +/+ or bcl-w −/− animals.
