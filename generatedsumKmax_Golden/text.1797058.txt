This was associated with loss of full-length α2δ-2 protein and expression of a truncated mutant α2δ-2 protein with aberrant function (Brodbeck et al , 2002). These results imply that nonsense-mediated decay of Cacna2d2 mRNA may be more effective in older animals. Using this technique, tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA was found to be up-regulated by 16.3 ± 0.79 fold (n = 10) in du2J/du2J cerebellum at P21 (Fig. A cDNA construct identical to this predicted product was made and expressed in Cos7 cells. Genomic DNA was prepared from tail biopsies and genotyping was carried out with primers 5′-GGACGTCTTCATCAGCTTCA-3′, and 5′-6FAM-TATACAGGGGGCCTCATCAC-3′, which produced a 219-bp product from the du2J allele, and a 221 bp product from the wild type allele. Tenascin-C exhibits several isoforms, and a progressive decrease in tenascin-C protein molecular weight has been reported to occur during cerebellar development (Bartsch et al , 1992). Differences between our two studies include the fact that the original du mutation also involves duplication of a substantial region of chromosome 9 including the semaphorin-3B gene (Barclay et al , 2001). In certain pathological situations, such as neuropathic pain, α2δ subunit expression is up-regulated (Luo et al , 2001; Newton et al , 2001). Quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from individual cerebella using the RNeasy lipid tissue kit and QiaShredders (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, Sussex, UK). Reverse transcription was carried out on 1 μg RNA using the iScript kit (BioRad, Hercules CA, USA). Finally, two ducky alleles (Cacna2d2du, Cacna2d2du2J) both predict truncation mutations in the α2δ-2 subunit (Snell, 1955; Barclay et al , 2001; Brodbeck et al , 2002), whereas the third ducky allele (Cacna2d2entla) predicts a full-length protein with an inserted region in the α2 moiety of α2δ-2 (Brill et al , 2004). The original ducky allele (du) involves a gene duplication and inversion which disrupts the Cacna2d2 gene within intron 3, but potentially also involves duplication and increased expression of other genes (Barclay et al , 2001). Patch pipettes were pulled from thick walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Hertfordshire, UK) to a tip resistance of 4–6 MΩ, when filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 KGluconate, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4 with NaOH and osmolarity 298 mOsm with 25 glucose.
