Loading solution was replaced with HBSS containing anti-fluorescein antibody and TSP1. In addition, TSP1 enhances cytokine-induced respiratory burst of human neutrophils (13) and enhances chemoattractant FMLP-mediated superoxide anion (O2−) generation by human neutrophils through its N-terminal domain (14, 15). This also indicates that TSP1 stimulates extracellular O2− production because SOD does not degrade intracellular O2−. The α6β1-binding peptide LALERKDHSG (24) and a function-blocking α6β1 antibody partially inhibited the activity of TSP1 on O2− generation. These results identify a specific requirement for α6β1 integrin to mediate TSP1 binding to human monocytes and the subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways required for O2− production (Fig. This acute change in PAI-1 expression in response to TSP1 is at least partially TGFβ-mediated. Interactions between integrins and their ligands can trigger transient elevation in intracellular free Ca2+ (43, 44), and Ca2+ is a well known intracellular second messenger for signaling the generation of O2− in human monocytes (45). Proteins and peptidesHuman TSP1 was purified from the supernatant of thrombin-activated platelets obtained from the NIH Blood Bank (20). Proteins and peptidesHuman TSP1 was purified from the supernatant of thrombin-activated platelets obtained from the NIH Blood Bank (20). Recombinant proteins containing various domains of TSP1 and TSP2 were prepared as previously described and provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (21-23). Rabbit polyclonal to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and rabbit polyclonal to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were from Abcam Inc. Anti-actin (Ab-1) mouse monoclonal antibody and EGTA were from Calbiochem. FITC-conjugated rat anti-human α6 monoclonal antibody (clone G0H3) and the isotype control were from BD Biosciences. The human monocytic line U937 (27) kindly provided by Dr. Mark Raffeld (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% endotoxin tested FBS (Biosource). In contrast, TSP1 expression in ischemic injuries limits tissue survival and restoration of perfusion by blocking NO/cGMP signaling (4). Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA/0.1% Tween 20/PBS and incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal to PAI-1 (2.5 μg/ml).
