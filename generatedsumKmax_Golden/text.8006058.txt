Specifically, we performed rank aggregation across three lists of genes ranked by differential expression, differential enhancer methylation, and differential enhancer accessibility in order to identify genes that are repressed upon decreased distal regulatory potential and vice versa. Our findings on epigenetic consequences of NSD1 mutations in HNSCCs complement recent advances in understanding the significance of H3K36me2 in cancer. Although the downstream epigenetic effects of NSD1 and NSD2 appear similar, mutations in those two methyltransferases are involved in distinct pathologies. We carried out an integrative gene set enrichment analysis, aiming to focus on the primary genes targeted by the regulatory cascade. Samples were centrifugated and pellets resuspended in 500ul of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Phenylarsine Oxide, 5 mM Sodium Orthovanadate and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet) and incubated 30 minutes on ice. The editing was confirmed by sequencing (MiSeq) of the regions surrounding the target sites (Figure S2A; Table S2), and the absence of the protein was confirmed by western blots of NSD1 (Figure S1C). As an association could also arise due to simple linear—rather than spatial—proximity, we included the distance of genes to their nearest cluster B bin as a covariate together with the status of sharing a TAD in logistic regression modeling (Figure 4). Next, in order to exclude the possibility that we may not be appropriately accounting for the distance effect, the continuous distance variable was substituted with a categorical surrogate to signify whether or not a gene is within a critical distance of the nearest cluster B bin. Finally, in an alternative approach to control for the distance effect, we used resampling to create lists of genes that are equal in size to the set of downregulated genes and have the same distribution of distance to the nearest cluster B bin.
