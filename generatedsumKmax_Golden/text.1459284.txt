Interestingly, a corneal wound caused by chemical cauterization induces capillaries to sprout and grow directly towards the wound edge (Burger et al , 1983). Although electric stimulation seems to promise a new approach to promoting angiogenesis in vivo (Kanno et al , 1999; Patterson et al , 1999), the cellular and molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Apart from its involvement in Ca2+ regulation, p160ROCK or Rho kinase can enhance the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Kimura et al , 1996). In the heart, this leads to a flow of injury current, intracellularly through junctionally coupled cells, with an extracellular return loop, and is thought to be involved in arrhythmogenesis (Coronel et al , 1991). In 70% of those cells, Vargas et al  (Vargas et al , 1994) observed that a small outward current was activated with a threshold of 0 mV (depolarization of membrane potential), whereas inward rectifying currents were activated with a threshold of 100 mV (hyperpolarization). In diastole, damaged extracellular areas become negative relative to undamaged areas, and this is reversed in systole, although the currents become more diffuse and are around one-third of their diastolic magnitude (Kleber et al , 1978). Extracellular injury currents, which create directly measured DC EFs of 58 mV cmâˆ’1, extend over about 8 mm at the boundary between ischemic and normal tissue (Coronel et al , 1991). Frequently (perhaps always), it occurs in the presence of directly measured endogenous EFs, which are generated by active ion transport across polarized epithelia and endothelia (Barker et al , 1982; Jaffe and Stern, 1979; Jaffe and Vanable, 1984; Nuccitelli, 1992; Hotary and Robinson, 1992; McCaig and Zhao, 1997; Zhao et al , 1999a). When the extent of ion pumping or of tissue electrical resistance varies spatially, steady direct-current (DC) EFs arise extracellularly (McCaig et al , 2002).
