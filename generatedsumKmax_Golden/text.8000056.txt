We show that loss of ArpC3 within this circuit is sufficient to recapitulate the reduced sociability of ArpC3 mutant mice. All procedures were conducted with a protocol approved by the Duke University and the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with US National Institutes of Health guidelines.We used HEK293T cells (ATCC; CRL-11268) to produce and purify adeno-associated viruses as well as to test the selective expression of Cre recombinase by co-expression of AAV-CreN-Rox-stop-Rox-CreC and AAV-WGA-Dre. The viral particles were then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (67,000 × g, 1 hr) using an iodixanol gradient solution (15%, 25%, 40% and 60%), and purified 3 times using an Amicon filter unit (100K MWCO; Millipore) by exchanging into PBS. For testing the circuit selective expression of Cre in the DG, AAV-CreN-Rox-stop-Rox-CreC (100nl; 1×1013 GC/ml) and AAV-WGA-Dre (100nl; 1×1013 GC/ml) were injected into each side of the DG (AP: −2.0, ML ± 1.5, DV: −2.0 from brain surface). Four weeks after surgery, brains were gently removed into ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution bubbled with 95% O2%–5% CO2 containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 10 D-glucose. During the recordings, the slice was maintained under continuous perfusion of oxygenated aCSF with a temperature of 28 – 30°C and a flow rate of 2–3 mL/min. The total distance traveled in each chamber, time spent on each chamber, number of transitions between chambers, and total distance moved were detected by photo beam breaks, and analyzed by Med Associates software.Elevated plus mazeThe elevated plus maze apparatus consisted of two open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two closed arms (30 × 5 cm) intersecting at a central platform (5 × 5 cm). During the elevated plus maze test, 5 min epochs with alternating laser stimulation was given (OFF-ON-OFF; 5 min per an epoch). However, manipulating genes within isolated neural circuits is difficult to achieve with high specificity due to technical limitations. Thus, this circuit-selective Dre and Cre approach confers an innovative method to express Cre recombinase within select unidirectional neural circuits of the brain. The amplitude of ctKO IPSC was significantly decreased in the PL compared with control (Figures 4N and 4O; p < 0.05 with t test, p < 0.001 with KS test).
