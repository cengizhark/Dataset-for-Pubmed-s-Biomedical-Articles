This siRNA specifically targets mouse Atf4 mRNA [Adams, 2007; Yu et al , 2008a]. For example, formation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex in early to mid G1 phase activates the kinases that phosphorylate and inactivate the tumor suppressor Rb, a critical step that is necessary for the transition from G1 to S phase [Kato et al , 1994; Sherr, 1994; Zhao et al , 2001]. An ATF/CRE site located in the proximal region of cyclin D1 promoter was reported to bind to CREB and AP1 proteins and mediate active transcription of the gene [Sabbah et al , 1999; Nagata et al , 2001; Datta et al , 2007]. It is also probable that ATF4 activates the cyclin D1 promoter through interactions with CREB and AP1 proteins. The embryonic lens in double homozygous p53/Atf4−/− mice does not undergo apoptosis [Tanaka et al , 1998; Hettmann et al , 2000]. ReagentsTissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan, UT). Cell Cultures and Isolation of Primary BMSCsMouse MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) preosteoblasts were described previously [Xiao et al , 1997; Wang et al , 1999] and maintained in ascorbic acid-free alpha-modified Eagle's medium (alpha-MEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (proliferation medium).
