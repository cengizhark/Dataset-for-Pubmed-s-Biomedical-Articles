Studies have shown that dolasetron is as effective as the local anaesthetic lidocaine at preventing pain, but may not be as effective in preventing shivering [56,57]. However, as the effects of this drug can only be seen 3 – 12 weeks after first use, the emergence of nausea in some patients is of importance. It has been shown that the systemic administration of the compounds has beneficial affects for patients suffering from fibromyalgia and the side effects of these compounds are few and often inconsequential. However, as the development costs of new therapeutics continue to rise, we may find new uses for existing compounds. These models indicate that the ligand binding site lies at the interface of two adjacent subunits and is formed by three loops (A – C) from the ‘principal’ subunit and three β-strands (D – F) from the adjacent or ‘complementary’ subunit. Comprehensive reviews of the 5-HT3 ligand binding site can be found in Thompson et al  [27,28]. M2 residues that lie along one side of an α-helix line the water-accessible pore [30,31], and a kink at the centre of the M2 helices forms a hydrophobic constriction that represents the channel gate. Although it was shown that the modulatory effects of n-alcohols and anaesthetics can be altered by mutations here, the authors concluded that they did not represent a binding site for these agents [36,37]. The binding site is formed at the interface of two adjacent subunits by the convergence of three amino acid loops (A – C) from one (the principal) subunit and three β-strands (D – F) from the adjacent (or complementary) subunit.
