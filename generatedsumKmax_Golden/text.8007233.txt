Organ failure due to accumulated injury from persistent haemolysis (Gardner et al, 2016) and sickling remains one of the major causes of death in patients with SCD (Vichinsky, 2017). We have previously reported the association between Pgf, inflammation, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and high mortality in patients with SCD (Perelman et al, 2003; Sundaram et al, 2010). Kolakowski et al , (2006) reported that direct intramyocardial injection of PGF following a large myocardial infarction attenuated adverse ventricular remodelling and improved myocardial function. PGF contributes to cardiac hypertrophy (Dewerchin & Carmeliet, 2012, Eiymo Mwa Mpollo et al, 2016, Roncal et al, 2010), through intermediate paracrine growth factors such as interleukin 6 (Accornero et al, 2011; Dewerchin & Carmeliet, 2012), which is known to be elevated in the serum of SCD patients (Taylor et al, 1995; Qari et al, 2012; Sarray et al, 2015). A recent investigation of blockade of PGF suggested beneficial effects in SS mice (Gu et al, 2018). Some of the mice received sterile vehicle (0.25 mol/l NaOH adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl used in preparation of haemin) as a control. Some of the mice received sterile vehicle (0.25 mol/l NaOH adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl used in preparation of haemin) as a control. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysates using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Catalogue number 217004, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and quantified using the Nanodrop 8000 micro-volume spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Relative quantification was calculated with the standard ΔΔCt method; amplification signals from target gene transcripts were normalized to those from beta-glucuronidase (Gusb) transcripts. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalogue number 23225) was used to quantify total protein in the lysates. HMOX1 and PGF protein quantificationHeart HMOX1 and PGF concentration were measured using the mouse HMOX-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and the PGF ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In the same heart lysates, PGF protein as a percentage of total heart protein increased by about 22% (P < 0.01), 29% (P < 0.05), and 18% (P < 0.01) in SS, Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice respectively (Fig 3B).
