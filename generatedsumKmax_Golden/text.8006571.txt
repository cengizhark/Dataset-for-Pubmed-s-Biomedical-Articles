The length of this context is an effective upper bound for query length.The vBWT (88) took another approach to using the BWT for indexing VCF-based pangenome graphs. Seven Bridges first searches for a near-exact match using an exponential depth-first search, applying partial order alignment if this fails (116).Due to the recent development of these methods, there have been few independent comparative studies of their performance and accuracy. Reduced reference bias and coherent representations of alleles yields significant improvements in structural variation detection and can decrease the runtime costs of genotyping. When our reference system is a linear genome, these two steps are often merged. Including known genetic variation in our pangenomic reference system can thus reduce bias towards the reference allele when genotyping heterozygous variants (Figure 3). Many of the works we have considered forsee a future in which reference systems are graphical, but only a handful (primarily those based on variation graphs) produce alignments or genotype calls in the context of a pangenome graph. If so, these reference systems are likely to proliferate as we explore the pangenome of humans and other species. Resequencing methods that use a pangenomic reference system should not be subject to this limitation.
