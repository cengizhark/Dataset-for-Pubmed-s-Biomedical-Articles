Canakinumab produces a 15% decrease in the primary composite endpoint (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD death) compared to placebo-treated individuals, which is accompanied by 60% reductions in C-Reactive Protein, a risk factor for future CVD events [116]. Conversely, the initiation of atherosclerotic plaque formation that frequently underlies CVD is characterized by deposition of lipoproteins within the vascular intima of arterial walls [10]. Moreover, atherosclerosis remains unchanged with deficiency of Antigen Peptide Transporter 1 (TAP-1), an essential component of the MHC class I presentation complex that participates in cross-presentation [142]. Subsequently, these lipoproteins undergo oxidation in the subendothelial space, which recruits inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and DCs into the plaque via damage-associated molecular patterns [11,12]. Clinical trials targeting interactions between CD40 and CD40L in atherosclerosis were discontinued due to thrombotic complications; nevertheless, an antisense oligonucleotide approach targeting CD40 may represent a promising approach [149,158]. These methods have been championed in the cancer field, revealing novel insight into potential immunotherapeutic targets in the cancer setting [36,52,162]. Monocytes have traditionally been classified into classical, nonclassical, and intermediate subsets, and this framework has provided the basis for functional studies to date. NR4A1 expression is controlled by the transcription factors KLF2 and C/EBPβ [5], but additional studies are needed to identify the signals driving this genetic program. Blockade of monocyte recruitment via CCR2 inhibition reduces macrophage-based production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-13, IL-15, and TNFɑ that can differentially impact T cell responses [50,57,58]. These observations warrant the continued exploration of Treg-monocyte interactions and potential for therapeutic targeting within the TIME. Monocytes upregulate both the PD-L1/2 and CD80/CD86 pathways as they enter the TIME and differentiate into TAMs [76]. Monocytes upregulate both the PD-L1/2 and CD80/CD86 pathways as they enter the TIME and differentiate into TAMs [76]. Classical Ly6Chi monocytes (Table 1, Figure 2) represent the first immune cell population to arrive at the atherosclerotic plaque via recruitment by CCR2-CCL2, CX3CR1-CX3CL1, and CCR5-CCL5 signaling [84,85].
