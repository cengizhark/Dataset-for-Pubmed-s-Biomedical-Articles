Additional studies will be required to establish the extent and functional role of heterocellular coupling in normal and diseased hearts, and whether there are differences in species ranging from mice to man. For α-SMA staining, as stated above, the primary antibody contained HRP (step 1). Subsequently, slides were incubated in Biotinyl Tyramide Amplification Reagent (1:300, NEN) for 10 min (step 2), followed by Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Jackson) for 30 min (step 3) and Hoechst nuclear stain (1:10,000, Cambrex Bioscience, Walkersville, MD) for 10 min for fluorescence visualization.For cadherin staining, mouse anti-pan-cadherin (1:300, Sigma) followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson) was used.Immunofluorescence images were photographed using an AxioCam digital camera attached to an Olympus BX60 microscope. Protein bands were visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (Perkin Elmer LAS, Boston, MA). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometric analysis using Adobe Photoshop.In some experiments, cell extracts were incubated in the presence (0.1 U/μg protein) or absence of alkaline phosphatase (Roche) at 37°C in a shaking water bath for 3 hr. After incubation for 2 min at 37°C, the monolayers were rinsed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted, and photographed using a fluorescence microscope and Nikon Coolpix 995 camera. We used the protein bands (40–45 kD) in the dried gel to normalize the connexin protein values obtained in Figure 2. Cx45 expression was not significantly different (p = 0.205) between the two cell types. Fibroblasts express Cx43 detected on immunoblots as protein bands at 41–46 kD.
