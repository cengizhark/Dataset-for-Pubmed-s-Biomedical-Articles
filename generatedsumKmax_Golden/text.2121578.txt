One key concept in the ethical and legal analysis relating to compulsory treatment is that of capacity to consent to, and refuse, treatment (Kennedy & Grubb, 2000). On this view, compulsory treatment is only justified if the patient lacks capacity (and the treatment is in the patient’s best interests). I go in to help at the school, and you see the happy children, and they’re carefree, and now K isn’t care free, nothing she does is care free. Capacity plays the key role within English common law (although not within the Mental Health Act) in answering the question of whether beneficial treatment can be imposed on a patient who is refusing it. Grisso and Appelbaum, although basing their analysis on legal precedents, go further than English (or US) law in their analysis of competence through introducing the notion of ‘appreciation’ in the MacCAT-T instrument (Grisso & Appelbaum, 1998b). Grisso and Appelbaum, however, in their further analysis of the concept of appreciation include aspects that go beyond the facts and understanding relevant to the specific decision and include the wider belief systems of the patient. One common argument that relates to efficacy is that it is harder, if not impossible, to engage patients in psychological therapies if their treatment is compulsory (Dresser, 1984; Rathner, 1998). This has been recognised in more recent treatment approaches by mental health professionals, who now use strategies such as motivational interviewing techniques to help ambivalent patients persuade themselves that the advantages of recovery outweigh the disadvantages (Treasure & Ward, 1997; Vitousek et al , 1998).
