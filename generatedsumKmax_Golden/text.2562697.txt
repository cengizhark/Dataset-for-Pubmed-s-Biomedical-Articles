Our data suggest that MMR can act as a damage sensor in response to FdU triggering ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest and cell death. However, other pathways, particularly BER, also play prominent roles in the cellular response. 1; see also [Stojic et al , 2004; Meyers et al , 2005; Yoshioka et al , 2006]). Finally, in vitro repair assays suggest that multiple BER enzymes may target FdU/G and FdU/A mispairs [Fischer et al , 2007]. While some studies point to the absence of survival benefit conferred by FU for MMR-deficient microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer patients suggesting that loss of MMR confers resistance or tolerance to FU [Meyers et al , 2003; Ribic et al , 2003; Benatti et al , 2005; Popat et al , 2005; Jover et al , 2006], other studies find the opposite, that is increased survival among MSI-H patients treated with FU or find no difference ([Lamberti et al , 2007] and references cited within). The MMR system has been implicated in cell killing by FPs as MMR-deficient cells exhibit increased survival after treatment with FdU [Meyers et al , 2004]. RECOMBINANT MUTSαHeterodimeric human MutSα (MSH2-His6-MSH6) was produced by coinfection (MOI = 10) of High Five (Invitrogen) maintained in Express Five (Invitrogen) with 18 mM glutamine (Invitrogen) at 27°C. MutSα was used within 1 week of purification. After 15 min at 25°C samples were loaded onto 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE. Cell cycle populations were quantified using ModFit LT version 3.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Cells were serially diluted (range, 2 × 102−2 × 104 cells/6−12 mm plate), plated in complete medium, and allowed to adhere for ∼15 h. FdU (0−7.5 μM) was then added to the medium for 10 days. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Comet tail moment was analyzed as described [Liu et al , 2005].
