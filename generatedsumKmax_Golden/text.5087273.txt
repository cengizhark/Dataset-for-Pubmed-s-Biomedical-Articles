These insights, coupled with new tools for targeting transcription factors and chromatin-modifying proteins (Table 1), suggest that small-molecule modulators of transcription will be useful for therapeutic manipulation of cytokine networks. For example, mutations in the cellular machinery that processes the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to its mature form cause hereditary auto-inflammatory diseases known as cryopyrin disorders (Figure 1a) [2]. Defining the tissue- and cell-specific functions of individual HDACs, coupled with development of isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors [48], will be needed to discover optimal therapeutic strategies for targeting this class of chromatin modulators. However, there are clear examples (e.g., IL-10 supplementation; IL-17A blockade in CD) where manipulation of individual cytokines has been ineffective, and studies of the genetics and physiology of these disorders has identified many intracellular proteins that contribute to disease pathogenesis. In addition, the discovery of risk and protective alleles for IBD in CARD9 suggests that scaffolding proteins may likewise be useful points of intervention [53]. Despite this success, several limitations of biopharmaceuticals hamper therapeutic manipulation of cytokine networks.
