For Hsp70 heterozygotes, the required clamp time increased to 25 min (Figure 2c). This study opens the door to potential treatment of ischemic AKI by showing that a nontoxic agent already in human use induces Hsp70 in mammalian cells, limits apoptosis, and preserves both organ structure and function even after the insult has occurred. Control animals were given an identical volume of vehicle only. Control animals were given an identical volume of vehicle only. Mice were placed onto a sterile, warmed operating table and kidneys were exposed by a midline incision. BUN and serum creatinineUpon completion of the in vivo experiments, a whole-blood sample was harvested either from the tail (BUN) or aorta (creatinine). The collagenase was neutralized with calf serum and the digested cortex was washed twice with buffered F12 medium. Cells were harvested and characterized as proximal tubule in origin as described previously by our laboratory63,64 and were maintained in a 50:50 (vol/vol) mixture of Dulbecco’s modied Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/Ham’s F12 medium containing insulin (5 mg/l), hydro-cortisone (50 nM), and apotransferrin (500 mg/l) and were cultured at 37 °C for 5–7 days in a 5% CO2 incubator. To assess the potential efficacy of GGA in Hsp70−/− mice, the duration of RPO was shortened to 21 min. In Hsp70+/+ mice, brief RPO failed to cause marked tubular injury in the presence or absence of GGA (Figure 3b, panels A vs C). Compared with Hsp70+/+mice, active caspase 3 increased by 548±58% and 1597±67% in the renal cortex of Hsp70+/− and Hsp70−/− animals, respectively (P<0.05 vs Hsp70+/+; n =  3).To confirm that Hsp70 per se inhibits Bax and promotes survival, active Bax was colocalized with a mitochondrial marker before and after ATP depletion in cultured primary proximal tubules cells harvested from Hsp70−/− mice in the presence and absence of exogenous Hsp70. GGA treatment also preserved tubular morphology after injury (Figure 7b) and improved animal survival.
