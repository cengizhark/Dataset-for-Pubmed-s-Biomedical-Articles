To stabilize 8-oxo-dG during automated fraction collection, 300 μL of TEMPO (75 mM) were added to the collection tubes. In the previously published study [15], this step was performed manually, and the fraction was either immediately capped and stored at −80 °C or the solvents were removed in the SpeedVac.To determine whether TEMPO prevents further oxidation of 8-oxo-dG, 100 nM 8-oxo-dG in aqueous solution were incubated with 15 mM TEMPO for 24 h at room temperature. Alternatively, sufficient separation of 8-oxo-dG from interfering peaks can be obtained by using a 5 μm particle capillary column that is operated at 10 °C [18].The main breakthrough towards a robust and reproducible method, however, was the availability of a heat assisted electrospray ionization source (HESI). More importantly, interfering peaks were essentially removed using HESI (Fig. FPG creates strand breaks at 8-oxo-dG sites that subsequently can be quantified via the single cell electrophoresis assay (comet assay) or alkaline elution techniques [10,11]. Further, to obtain sufficient sensitivity and to increase reproducibility, adduct enrichment is needed. Second, sample enrichment by HPLC fraction collection, immunoaffinity chromatography [17,23] or online column switching [22] is essential to achieve sufficient sensitivity and to remove potential interferences. Cell linesHeLa S3 cells were obtained in suspension from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This was followed by the addition of 2.7 mU phosphodiesterase I and 2U alkaline phosphatase with continued incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. Enrichment of 8-oxo-dG by HPLCDNA filtrates were transferred to high-recovery, glass autosampler vials, and 8-oxo-dG was purified by reverse phase HPLC using an Ultrasphere ODS C18 4.6 mm×250 mm 5 μm column (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The gradient program provided by an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was as follows: 7% methanol, 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 4.3) for 22 min, then increasing methanol linearly to 80% in 1 min and holding for 6 min. A 2.1 mm×100 mm HSS T3 C18, 1.8 μm column (Waters, Milford, MA) was operated with a linear gradient of 1% methanol and 0.1% acetic acid in water to 5% methanol in 2 min and then held for 10 min, followed by an increase to 50% methanol in 2 min, at a flow rate of 200 μl/min.
