Error bars represent the standard deviation of n=3 independent experiments. We confirmed that the DIGIT-4xS1m transcript was retained in the nucleus after transient transfection (Figure 1A), as previously described for endogenous DIGIT4, and precipitated DIGIT-4xS1m with streptavidin beads in UV cross-linked cells (Figure 1B). (A) PONDR VSL2 plots showing the ordered and disordered regions of the long (left) and short (middle) isoforms of BRD3, and BRD2 (right). Scale bar represents 2 μm. The bold horizontal line represents the median for each box plot. The lower whiskers represent Q1–1.5*(Q3-Q1) and the upper whisker represents Q3+1.5*(Q3-Q1). Supplementary Table 1 Supplementary Table 2 Supplementary Table 4 Future studies are needed to determine if DIGIT, BRD3 and SMARCD1 are present in the same complex.To understand how BRD3 interacts with the entire transcriptome, we performed RIP using an antibody against BRD3 followed by sequencing of precipitated RNA. BET proteins contain two bromodomains, which bind acetylated histones7,8, and an extra-terminal domain that enables interaction with other proteins, including transcription factors and co-activators9–12. To investigate whether BRD3 puncta are phase-separated condensates, we first asked if BRD3 forms condensates in live cells. These findings demonstrate that each BET protein forms nuclear condensates in definitive endoderm, and the condensates formed by BRD3 are distinct from those formed by BRD2 and BRD4. The equivalent intensity of droplet formation was not observed under these conditions until a BRD3 concentration of greater than 1 μM in the presence of SCRM or in the absence of RNA (Figure 4D).
