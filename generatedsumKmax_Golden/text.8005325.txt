Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 minutes, rinsed, and plaques were counted. Cells were infected with the African ZIKV MR766 and Puerto Rican ZIKV PRVABC59 strains at a low MOI (MOI 0.1) and incubated for six days. Supernatant was collected for six days and ZIKV RNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The presence of mosquito Rps6 transcripts confirmed successful RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Aag2 cells are more frequently utilized for DENV virus studies (Walker et al , 2014) and CFAV has previously been shown to promote DENV infection (Zhang et al , 2017) suggesting that PCLV may have a more mild effect on DENV growth in a coinfection setting. Cells were infected at a low MOI of 0.1 and a high MOI of 10 with LACV followed by a six or three day incubation, respectively, as depicted in Figure 4A. Cells were subcultured 1:10 weekly. Virus supernatant was spun at 4,000 RCF, filtered and aliquoted. Supernatant RNA was extracted by Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit per manufacturer recommendations. Cells were incubated at 28Â°C with 5% CO2 for 6 days. Media was replaced at 24 hours post infection. Supernatant RNA was extracted by Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit per manufacturer recommendations.
