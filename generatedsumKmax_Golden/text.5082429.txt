These communicative actions begin early in the first months of life when an infant shares eye-to-eye gaze with a parent and ‘looks where someone else is looking’ (Butterworth & Jarrett, 1991; Scaife & Bruner, 1975). We consider these functions next. Whether social attention in any of its functions and forms can be differentiated from other non-social domains of activity has been rarely examined in a direct way.One possibility would be that early in development, attention regulation capacity in the context of non-social and social events is isomorphic, but begins to diverge during the 8–12 month period, concurrent with the emergence of endogenous attention and executive function (resulting from brain maturation) along with cortical specialization for social stimuli, and ultimately becomes independent through the expression of social interaction behaviors (e.g., joint attention, nonverbal communication).
