This eliminated possible build up of chemoattractant or ionic gradients and maintained a stable temperature and pH across the chamber during experiments. PI 3-kinase signalling is the compass mechanism in chemotactic directional sensing in Dictyostelium, neutrophils and fibroblasts (Ilijima and Devreotes, 2002; Servant et al , 2000; Xu et al , 2003; Firtel and Chung, 2000; Haugh et al , 2000). Y27632 was used to inhibit p160ROCK and Toxin B was used as a general inhibitor of Rho, Rac and Cdc42. These include chemoattractant gradients (Nabi, 1999; Xu et al , 2003; Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003), mechanical forces (Li et al , 2002; Decave et al , 2003; Wojciak-Stothard and Ridley, 2003) and gradients of adhesiveness (Libotte et al , 2001). However, BFA treatment did significantly inhibit electrotaxis by reducing the directedness value from 0.93 in to 0.28 (compare Fig. Chemical gradients inevitably form at the wound (Hansen et al , 1993; Sammak et al , 1997; Klepeis et al , 2001). CO2- independent medium was used for experiments performed in room atmosphere. 1 coverglass was applied and sealed with DC4 on top of the chamber as described (Zhao et al , 1996). The dish was placed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with temperature control at 37Â°C. lamellipodia or pseudopodia where active membrane protrusion occurs (Ridley et al , 2003; Manes et al , 2003; Jaffe and Hall, 2003; Nabi, 1999; Xu et al , 2003; Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003). Migration rate was analysed with the following three parameters. Electric field-directed Golgi polarization and asymmetric actin polymerizationIn CHO cells cultured in an applied EF of 300 mV/mm both the Golgi apparatus and actin filaments polarized towards the cathode (Fig.
