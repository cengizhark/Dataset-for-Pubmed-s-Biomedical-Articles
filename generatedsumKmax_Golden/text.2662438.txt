The mixture was then heated slowly to 110 °C and kept at the same temperature for 1 h to produce a suspension. Subsequently, another promising candidate 3-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-DCK (3, HMDCK) showed moderate bioavailabity, but lacked activity in a drug resistant strain.8 Guided by SAR and 3D-QSAR results,9 our research efforts next focused on the development of drug candidates with better pharmacokinetic profiles and potent anti HIV-1 drug-resistant activity. The crude product could be used in the next reaction without further purification. As stated above, because 4 is a good potential drug candidate for preclinical studies, a practical synthesis for scale-up of 4 is merited and has been developed. The total yield of 4 was significantly increased from 7.8% in the original seven-step synthesis6 to 32% in the new ten-step synthesis with optimized conditions, as shown in Scheme 1 and Table 1. The monolayers were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator with pre-warmed transport media. However, increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART regimens fail to respond to current antiretroviral drugs due to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants.1 Therefore, it is essential to develop additional potent anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action or resistance profiles different from those of current anti-HIV therapeutics. Other phase-transfer catalysts, including benzyltriethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylammonium chloride, dibenzo-18-crown-6, and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, were also investigated in the two-phase reaction system (data not shown), but Bu4N+I− gave better results.
