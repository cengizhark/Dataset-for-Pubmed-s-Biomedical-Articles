The O-GlcNac modification at β-catenin was decreased in siOGT and triptolide treated samples as compared to controls. Even though significant advances have been made in order to understand the mechanism of action of Minnelide, we still do not have a full understanding of the pathways affected by this compound. Several other studies have also shown that levels of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation are upregulated in different cancers, including pancreatic cancer [11]. This was consistent with the findings that administration of Minnelide suppressed the growth of pancreatic tumors in STIM mice. ChIP was performed by using standard protocol of Pierce Agarose Chip kit (Thermo Fisher scientific). Anti-β-catenin antibody (Chip grade, Millipore) was used to immunoprecipitate the β-catenin binding regions. The ChIP results were analyzed with quantitative real time PCR by using SP5 and c-Myc promoter region primers from Millipore. The ChIP results were analyzed with quantitative real time PCR by using SP5 and c-Myc promoter region primers from Millipore. Indeed, the past three decades spent on understanding the oncogenic pathways that fuel malignant transformation and proliferation have certainly not led to significant gains in the clinics for patients with this dismal diagnosis. STIM (syngenic tumor implantation model)Isolation of tumors and tumor implantation was done according to Majumder et al , 2015 [22]. After two weeks of tumor implantation, mice were treated with 0.21 mg/kg/day Minnelide by IP injection. Typically, the deregulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway genes (β-catenin and Axin) are implicated in the tumorigenesis at various sites including the colon and pancreas [1,3,4]. The reduction was more effective when both (LRP6 and FZD) silencing RNAs were used in the culture at the same time.
