This report summarizes the experience of using PROMIS and legacy measures of symptoms and functioning in the same RCT with a clinical sample of advanced breast cancer patients and a community sample of their friend or family caregivers. Greater responsiveness and conceptual content, not limited to negative affect and relevant for cancer survivors and their caregivers, strongly support the use of the legacy CES-D and the SF-36 mental health versus PROMIS depression 4-item short form in the populations reflected by this trialâ€™s patient and caregiver samples. The one-item MDASI distress item for patients demonstrated similar responsiveness to the longer CES-D and SF-36 mental health subscale, and the MDASI item of sadness yielded the same conclusion as a longer PROMIS depression measure reflecting negative affect. However, because several legacy tools produced the same result which differed from the results obtained using PROMIS depression, and because this finding was seen in both patient and caregiver samples, it is likely that the legacy measures performed better in capturing intervention effects on depression. The attractiveness of PROMIS measures for this study stemmed from the ability to use these measures with both the clinical sample of breast cancer patients and the general population sample of their friend or family caregivers. The results of the primary analysis are reported elsewhere.19 An exploratory aim of the parent trial used a different set of measures for patient and caregiver symptoms and functioning to contribute to the growing evidence of psychometric properties of PROMIS measures by comparing their responsiveness to that of legacy measures. The majority (70%) of the caregivers agreed to be interviewed about their own health outcomes. In this report, five of the eight attributes were analyzed: physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, and social role functioning. Medical records provided data on patient disease and treatment.1.4.1 |Data analysisThe comparisons of PROMIS and legacy measures were conducted separately for the patient sample and the caregiver sample. General linear models for this analysis included trial arm and baseline values as covariates. Also consistently, PROMIS and legacy measures indicated sizable significant effects of reflexology for the management of anxiety among patients, not among the caregivers, and no intervention effects on sleep for either patients or caregivers.
