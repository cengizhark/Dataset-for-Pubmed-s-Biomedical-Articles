Artemin-neutralizing antibodies had little effect on neuroprotection by control MBECs, but reduced neuroprotection by EC-Rac1+/− MBECs by half. It remains to be determined, therefore, what the effect of sustained inhibition of endothelial Rac1 is on neurogenesis, which is coupled to angiogenesis within the neurovascular niche (52, 53). The mRNA abundance was normalized with GAPDH mRNA or 18S ribosomal RNA. After centrifugation in 45% Percoll (20,000g), the top layer was plated in DMEM/F12 with 10% horse serum, 10% FCS, heparin, antibiotics, and ECGF. Relative CBF returned to >95% of baseline values, indicating almost complete reperfusion without residual occlusion.Cerebral infarct volume was measured 22 hr after reperfusion. Briefly, fluorescent dye labeling was performed using the Atlas Powerscript Fluorescent Labeling Kit (Clontech). Neuroprotection in the transient MCAo model is thought to depend on two major factors: residual cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic region and CBF-independent, direct neuroprotective components, such as BBB functionality and growth factor–mediated neurosurvival. The fluorescent images were acquired by TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica). At day 8, photographs were taken to evaluate capillary outgrowth.Statistical analysis.Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analysis was carried out by ANOVA followed by Fisher's test. Photographs were taken at day 8. 2, D and F, Supplementary text, Table 2, and tables S1 and S3).
