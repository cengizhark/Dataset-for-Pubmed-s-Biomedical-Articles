3d and e. The mean values for the two series are used to define the swash and backwash stages of Wave III in Fig. 9 which shows the superimposed cumulative curves from the previous figure to define susceptible, infective and recovered zones when plotted on a phase diagram. This spread process is set into reverse as populations recover and previously-infected areas are cleared. A summary of the mechanisms involved and examples of such spread are given elsewhere (Haggett 2000; Cliff et al  2000). The swashâ€“backwash model may be readily adjusted to include such non-discrete examples by resetting the threshold so that either (a) qij > 1 or (b) a particular threshold rate (cases/susceptible population) is exceeded. Making comparisons across different spatial scales and between countries (each of which has its own recording infrastructure) is a classic geographical problem which has long attracted statistical research (Duncan et al  1961). Here, we have concentrated on the changing spatial distribution of the wave, and we have presented a simple method for identifying the leading and trailing edges of the spatial advance and retreat of such waves. In this first section we modify standard statistical methods to provide some elementary measures of spatial form and then illustrate their application through a small hypothetical example. Bailey 1975) but with the essential difference that our population is made up of areas (SA, IA and RA) rather than individuals. The epidemiological significance of the integral values is discussed later in this paper.
