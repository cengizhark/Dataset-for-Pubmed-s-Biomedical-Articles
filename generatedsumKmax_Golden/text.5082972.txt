In this study, we assessed the awareness, attitudes, beliefs, and motivation of overweight state employees covered by the NC State Health Plan who would be directly affected by these health plan changes prior to the health benefit changes going into effect. Employees’ perception of their BMI status will not necessarily match their actual (measured) BMI status.Employees in the highest BMI categories would be less likely to favor the new benefit plan changes, to believe in its potential for helping employees lose weight, and to report confidence in their ability to lose weight compared to employees in lower BMI categories.Overweight employees who smoke would be less likely to favor the new benefit plan changes or believe in its potential for helping employees quit smoking compared with former smokers and non-smokers. Moreover, respondents with BMI ≥ 40 were more likely to report that the new health benefit change would not be effective in helping employees lose weight (Table 3). This study took advantage of a unique opportunity to reveal attitudes and beliefs about health plan changes from overweight employees prior to the enactment of a new lifestyle-related health benefit plan change that would likely affect them directly given their weight status. Our results indicate that many state employees who are likely to be affected by health plan changes related to BMI often underestimated their true BMI, and thus, did not understand that their weight would affect their health benefit plan status. Moreover, among these overweight or obese individuals, current smokers and those with higher BMI categories were less likely to report that the tobacco and weight-related benefit plan changes were a good idea, or would help them quit smoking or lose weight. Communication efforts can assist employees in understanding the new health insurance benefit changes in advance of their implementation, including the potential costs they might face.
