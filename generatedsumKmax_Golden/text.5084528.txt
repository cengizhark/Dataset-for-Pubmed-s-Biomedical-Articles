An experiment is entirely dependent on the delivery date of infant rabbits. The bundle-forming toxin coregulated pilus (TCP) is V. cholerae’s chief colonization factor (Taylor et al , 1987), but many other gene products also facilitate the pathogen’s growth in the host intestine (Ritchie and Waldor, 2009). V. cholerae secretes cholera toxin (CT) in the intestine, and the action of this A-B5 type toxin causes the secretory diarrhea characteristic of cholera, primarily by stimulating chloride release from enterocytes into the intestinal lumen (Sears and Kaper, 1996). After a short incubation time (about 5 min), take out the instruments and let them dry by air.Grab the navel mark with the tissue forceps and make a small incision through the skin and peritoneal wall with the dissection scissors (Fig. Detach the gut by severing the remaining connections of connective tissue and transfer the entire tissue to a clean dissection board. However, at the end stage of the disease the majority of cecal content has been excreted and very little fluid can be recovered.Disentangle the gut and align it on the dissection board.Find the beginning of the duodenum (Fig.
