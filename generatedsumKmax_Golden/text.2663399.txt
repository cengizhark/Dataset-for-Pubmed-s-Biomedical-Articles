These enzymes act in a sequential manner to activate and transfer ubiquitin to its substrate55 (Box 2, Fig. In humans, K63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA appears to involve two E3 ubiquitin ligases, HLTF (helicase-like transcription factor)40,43 and SHPRH (SNF2 histone linker PHD RING helicase)41,42. Moreover, overexpression of either protein in human cells leads to increased PCNA polyubiquitination in vivo40,42,43. Moreover, when ssDNA formation at the fork is blocked by preventing helicase-polymerase uncoupling, PCNA ubiquitination does not occur36. Based on this and other observations, the interaction between Rad5 and Rad18 has been hypothesized to coordinate the switch from mono- to polyubiquitination of PCNA through a physical coupling of the two sets of ubiquitin enzymes56. Despite similarities in the structure of the activating signal, ATR function is not required for PCNA ubiquitination in yeast32,74 or Xenopus laevis35,36 and most studies in human cells are consistent with this idea44,51,81. It is also worth noting that Rad1885 and possibly also HLTF and SHPRH may be substrates of the checkpoint kinases. Evolutionarily speaking, mutagenesis is the mechanism through which natural selection acts, and it is the basis for adaptation and species diversification. Of particular importance is the sequential manner in which PCNA ubiquitination occurs. Importantly, PCNA is polyubiquitinated through K63-linked chains22,34,43, and neither mono- nor polyubiquitination of PCNA appears to promote its degradation. The ubiquitination of PCNA requires the proper coordination and assembly of a number of enzymes.
