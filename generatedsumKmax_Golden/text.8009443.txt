With a short chain length, there might be insufficient repeat unit binding sites for target-analyte interaction due to dense packing of the short polymer chains at the substrate surface.15 In this work, we focus on the use of SERS and linear polymers as affinity agents for multiplex analyte detection. The mixture was dialyzed in a 100–500 Da MWCO membrane against 3 L of Milli-Q water for 24 h. This was then lyophilized resulting in a dry, light yellow solid with a yield of 78%. Raw ITC profiles (Figure S2a and S2b) are measured as heat flow rate against time where each peak refers to the injected sample. FONs with a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) λmax between 750 and 850 nm, measured using a fiber optic probe (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, Florida) with a flat gold film as the reflective standard, were used for these studies. Samples were prepared in a biosafety level II hood (BSCII). All instrumentation, benchtops, and hoods are sprayed with a 10% bleach solution and wiped down to avoid any harmful effects. DFT modeling of deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin ARaman detection of DON in agricultural products by Yuan et al 45 modeled the small molecule with density functional theory (DFT). Previous Raman detection of OTA has relied on dye molecules,29 changes in aptamer conformation,46 and other intensity-amplifying attachments30 in order to sense the small molecule. Distinct and visible spectral changes are observed at concentrations as low as the OTA regulatory limit (0.005 ppm/5 ppb). Multiplex SERS detection of deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A with pAEMA29In an effort to detect both toxins simultaneously, both DON and OTA were placed in solution with pAEMA29 to give both the opportunity to complex with the polymer affinity agent via the hypothesized hydrogen bonding/association.
