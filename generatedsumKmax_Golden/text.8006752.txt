The correct interpretation of BAP1 IHC is critical in cancer diagnosis and also in research; therefore, we will review this issue, which, in our experience, is confusing to many (Fig. Moreover, negative BAP1 nuclear staining in both epithelioid and spindle cells confirms the diagnosis of biphasic mesothelioma (Fig. BAP1 is a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH), a member of the deubiquitylase (DUB) family of proteins. However, very recently Hassan and colleagues reported that BAP1 status does not determine sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in patient-derived mesothelioma cell lines (140). Thus, the role of EZH2 inhibitors in BAP1-deficient cancers remains unclear, and the results of a clinical trial on tazemetostat in mesothelioma that has been completed are being evaluated (ref. However, the improved survival predates screening, as it was also observed in family members who were diagnosed before the discovery of the BAP1 cancer syndrome (67). The increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration triggers the release of cytochrome c that in turn activates apoptosis (33). Moreover, using a genetically engineered inducible Bap1 knockout murine model, it has been demonstrated that the deletion of Bap1 altered several metabolic pathways. Moreover, breast cancers and basal cell carcinomas are also quite frequent and will likely be included among the “core cancers” as more data accumulate (8, 55–57). Following this low exposure, Bap1+/− mice developed mesothelioma at a comparable rate to wild-type mice (Bap1+/+ mice) exposed to ten times higher doses of asbestos (62).
