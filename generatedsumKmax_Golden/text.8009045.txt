For additional information related to selection of mice, number of mice cohort tested in independent experiments, and other details, see Supplemental Methods and Materials. Behavior took place at the same time during the day cycle, with control and experimental mice tested together each time, rotating between groups to counterbalance for order effects. For details on locomotor/open field, elevated plus maze, sucrose consumption test, forced swim test, and accelerating rotarod test, see Supplemental Methods and Materials.

In addition, there was a trend toward significance on the distance traveled in the center (p = .08), such that knockout animals traveled approximately half of the distance measured in wild-type control animals within the center; however, these two groups did not differ on distance traveled in the perimeter of the open field (F = 1.768, p > .05) (Figure 1G). Total numbers of hippocampal GRir cells were significantly and positively correlated to both of these anxiety measures across all animals (Table 2), suggesting that decreased levels of hippocampal GR are associated with the increased anxiety behavior in mice.To better characterize HPA axis activity in the Fgf2 KO animals, we examined GR and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) ir cells within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which contains the CRH cell bodies important for the hypothalamic regulation of the HPA axis. Together, the data suggest that FGF2 is crucial for maintenance of GR expression in differentiated neurons of the hippocampus, which, in turn, affects CRH protein expression within neurons of the PVN but not in the amygdala, consistent with the inhibitory role of the hippocampus on the HPA axis.Corticosterone Responsivity.Previous studies have shown that the profile observed in the current phenotype of Fgf2 KO mice, i.e., decreased hippocampal GR expression together with increases in PVN CRH, is associated with increased corticosterone response to an anxiogenic stimulus (29). Therefore, we performed a rescue experiment by administering either vehicle or FGF2 ligand daily for 1 week to adult Fgf2 KO or wild-type control mice and then assessing anxiety behavior, hippocampal GR levels, and circulating baseline corticosterone levels.Behavior.Adult male wild-type mice and Fgf2 KO mice were injected daily for 7 days with vehicle or FGF2 (see timeline, Figure 3A) and then tested on the elevated plus maze, open field test, and forced swim test. No effect of FGF2 treatment on anxiety behavior was seen in control wild-type mice (EPM: F = 0.003, p > .05; open field: F = 6.849E-5, p > .05) (Figure 3B, C).
