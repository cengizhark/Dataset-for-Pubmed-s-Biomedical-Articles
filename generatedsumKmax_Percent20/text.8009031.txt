Oncogenic signaling promoted synthesis of negative regulators, such as DUSPs and SPRY proteins, but many of these act upstream of BRAF, making negative feedback more effective against the physiological than oncogenic configuration. Only when ligands were present did RTKs dimerize, recruit GRB2:SOS1 and generate RAS-GTP (Figure 5C). Some reports suggest that ERK remains largely inhibited (Pratilas et al , 2009; Montero-Conde et al , 2013; Fallahi-Sichani et al , 2015), whereas others suggest that it rebounds (Lito et al , 2012).

Some reports suggest that ERK remains largely inhibited (Pratilas et al , 2009; Montero-Conde et al , 2013; Fallahi-Sichani et al , 2015), whereas others suggest that it rebounds (Lito et al , 2012). Two molecular mechanisms were responsible for this differential sensitivity to drug in the model: (1) inhibition of MEK phosphorylation by BRAFV600E occurred near the drug IC50, but MEK phosphorylation by BRAF/CRAF dimers was not affected because RAF dimers can phosphorylate MEK even when it is bound by MEK inhibitors, presumably due to the different stereochemistry of the underlying complexes (Hatzivassiliou et al , 2013; Lito et al , 2014) (Figures 5Div and 5Dv); (2) once MEK is phosphorylated, its affinity for MEK inhibitors falls ~10-fold, resulting in less potent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, as estimated by model parameters (Figure 5Diii). Experiments confirmed these predictions, which could be recapitulated with three growth factors other than EGF (Figure 5G) and with trametinib plus dabrafenib (Figure S3D). When the oncogenic configuration is inhibited, negative feedback on receptors is relieved. This configuration is responsive to factors in the local microenvironment and is resistant to both RAF and MEK inhibitors. It might therefore seem logical to target growth factors to improve therapeutic response. However, multiple receptors (e.g., ERBB1/2, c-MET, and FGFR) (Straussman et al , 2012; Wilson et al , 2012) are individually capable of inducing ERK pulsing when cognate ligands are present. We propose that persistence in drug-adapted melanoma cells and primary resistance in cancers expressing abundant RTKs (e.g., EGFR in colorectal cancers) differ primarily in the duration of ERK activation: sporadic pulsing is sufficient for persistence but chronic or frequent signaling is necessary for tumor growth.In our studies, spontaneous ERK pulses likely arise from localized release of growth factors enhanced by non-uniform distribution of RTKs at a single-cell level (Shaffer et al , 2017; Spencer et al , 2009). Live-cell movies suggest that dying cells are another likely source of autocrine/paracrine signals, possibly including presentation of the AXL ligand Gas6 in the context of phosphatidylserine lipids (Müller et al , 2014). Our computational model shows that multiple biochemical mechanisms, including the resistance of RAF dimers downstream of RTKs to RAF inhibitors, the ability of MEK inhibitors to block MEK phosphorylation by monomeric BRAFV600E, but not dimeric RAF, and the higher affinity of MEK inhibitors for unphosphorylated MEK are all involved in creating a wide dose range over which combined RAF and MEK inhibitors suppress oncogenic signaling but potentiate receptor-driven ERK pulsing (the physiological configuration in Figure 7B).Could new drugs or drug combinations be deployed to block pulsatile MAPK signaling and the emergence of persister cells? For simplicity, we have focused mechanistic modeling on the protypical autocrine ligand EGF, even though this might not be the only relevant ligand in human tumors.

Animals in the second group were given equivalent volumes of OG and IP vehicle controls (VV control group). Tumor volume was calculated from daily measurements by caliper (see Figure S5A). After 5 days, mice were transcardially perfused with oxygenated and heparinized Tyrode’s solution which allowed for simultaneous euthanasia and exsanguination. Flank xenografts were then surgically removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and stored at 4 °C for 48 h. All fixed tumors from a single group were uniformly paraffin embedded into a single block holder and sectioned in 5 μM slices.Xenograft for Live-Cell Intravital ImagingAll animal research was performed in accordance with guidelines from the Institutional Subcommittee on Research Animal Care, and studies related to intravital microscopy were performed under approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Massachusetts General Hospital. Window chambers were sealed with sterile coverslips, and mice were supplied prophylactically with drinking water containing antibiotics. The performance of A375_a in overexpressing endogenous genes was evaluated by individually targeting 3 control genes (CDKN1C, SLC4A1, POU5F1) and measuring gene expression changes by RT-qPCR (dataset provided in Synapse database, see Table S4 and Data availability). CRISPRi and CRISPRa A375 Cell Lines Targeting EGFRPairs of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) forming sgRNA protospacers flanked by BstXI and BlpI restriction sites were annealed and ligated into BstXI/BlpI double digested plasmid pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP (Addgene #60955). Reactions were diluted four-fold with water and qPCR was performed in 10 μL reactions in 384-well plates using PowerUp SYBR Green PCR Master mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 μL of diluted cDNA preparation, and 0.4 μM of primers using a QuantStudio 6 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All qPCR primers are listed in the dataset provided in Synapse database, see Table S4 and Data availability. Log2 fold changes in expression were then determined by the difference between the ΔCt value of targeting sgRNAs and that of a non-targeting negative control sgRNA (A375_iNC or A375_aNC) (ΔΔCt). After adding 20 mL complete medium, cells were thoroughly homogenized into a single cell suspension.

In treated subjects, 25 mg/kg dabrafenib and 2.5 mg/kg trametinib (both from LC labs) were given by oral gavage in water with 1% DMSO and 0.5% methylcellulose, 48 hr and again 24 hr prior to the imaging session. HRP was detected using ECL substrate purchased from Thermo Scientific (#34076) using a myECL Imager, and signals were quantified using the Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR Biosciences) by normalizing the specific signal for each sample to the Actin signal.

In patients, therapeutic responses to combined RAF and MEK inhibition therapy are often rapid and dramatic, but in most cases they are also transitory due to the emergence of drug-resistant clones (Groenendijk and Bernards, 2014). Within the largest pulses, which could involve up to 80 cells, ERK activity appeared to propagate over successive movie frames from a point of origin toward distant cells, taking up to ~20 min to reach to the furthest cells (Figure 1J; Video S1). We conclude that pulsatile ERK activity is associated with slow proliferation and survival under drug treatment but that not every pulse results in cell division: as shown previously, the relationship between ERK pulsing and cell division is probabilistic (Albeck et al , 2013).When A375 cells were exposed to vemurafenib (1μM) and cobimetinib for 1 to 4 days over a 100-fold concentration range (0.01–1μM) and assayed by fixed-cell microscopy, the fraction of pERK-high cells fell 10 to 1,000-fold compared with DMSO-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in seven other BRAF-mutant melanoma lines. Pan-RAF inhibitors inhibited pulsing over multiple days of drug exposure whereas SHP099 acted transiently (Figure 3B), but neither was as effective as 1-μM cobimetinib (Figures 3A and S1C). Phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins was monitored by immunofluorescence. However, even when ERK is largely inhibited (at 1-μM vemurafenib), phosphorylation of EGFR, CBL, GRB2, and SHP2 remains low (<5% of total protein) (Figure 4D). However, even when ERK is largely inhibited (at 1-μM vemurafenib), phosphorylation of EGFR, CBL, GRB2, and SHP2 remains low (<5% of total protein) (Figure 4D). A similar biphasic response of pERK to cobimetinib was observed using three other growth factors (Figures 4I and 4J). This is surprising because protein kinase inhibitors usually act by blocking the ability of kinases to phosphorylate downstream substrates, in this case ERK, and not by blocking phosphorylation of the kinase being inhibited (i.e., MEK). To better understand the mechanisms responsible for these and other data we turned to a mechanistic computational model that recapitulates key properties of the MAPK pathway.
