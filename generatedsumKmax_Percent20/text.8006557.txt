Adenosine vasoconstricts afferent arterioles at low concentrations but evokes vasodilation at higher concentrations (Nishiyama et al  2001a, Hansen et al  2005, Lai et al  2006). Micropuncture studies show that mouse TGF responses, measured by changes in stop-flow pressure, were absent during A1 receptor blockade with 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine or A1 receptor knockdown (Sun et al  2001, Hashimoto et al  2006), implicating adenosine as a mediator of TGF. Moreover, autoregulation of RBF and GFR was impaired in A1 receptor deficient mice (Hashimoto et al  2006), suggesting that this impairment of renal autoregulation may reflect an abolished TGF mechanism. The fourth mechanism is referred to as the connecting tubule-glomerular feedback (CTGF) mechanism (Ren et al  2007). That work suggests that lack of efficient autoregulatory control renders glomeruli susceptible to hyperfiltration and hypertensive kidney injury putting the host at high risk for kidney failure, particularly in African-Americans with hypertension (Palmer 2004). Work in recent decades shows that renal autoregulatory capability is impaired in hypertensive animal models including Ang II, Goldblatt (2K-1C), deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt, the 5/6 renal mass reduction, Fawn-hooded rats and Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats (Ploth et al  1981, Karlsen et al  1997, Griffin et al  2004, Burke et al  2013, Guan et al  2013, 2016). Consistent with in vitro findings, MMF-treated Ang II-infused rats also exhibited normal whole kidney autoregulation of RBF, reduced plasma TGF-β levels and less glomerular injury despite similar hypertensive conditions in Ang II-infused control rats (Guan et al  2013). The Dahl SS rat is a well-characterized hypertensive model, which rapidly develops hypertension and glomerular injury upon high salt (HS) diet feeding. ETS-1 is a transcription factor targeting the chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and mediates vascular inflammatory and fibrotic effects (Zhan et al  2005). The SS rats receiving a low salt diet exhibited normal autoregulatory reactivity which was lost if the HS diet was given. These observations are consistent with the findings of Elmarakby et al  (2007) showing that pharmacological inhibition of chemokine receptor 2b preserved pressure-induced afferent arteriole vasoconstriction in Ang II-infused hypertensive rats. 2), suggesting that inflammation also impairs P2X1 receptor signaling but has no detectable impact on A1 and P2Y2 receptor activation in afferent arterioles of hypertensive rats (Inscho et al  2011, Guan et al  2016). Acute P2 receptor blockade with intra-aortic infusion of PPADS or the P2X1 receptor antagonist, NF449, restored afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance and single nephron GFR to normal in Ang II-infused rats without changes in mean arterial pressure (Franco et al  2011, 2017). P2X7 receptor blockade with the specific antagonist AZ11657312 increased medullary blood flow, improved pressure-natriuresis and reduced glomerular macrophage infiltration via a NO-dependent mechanism (Menzies et al  2015a), suggesting that activation of P2X7 receptor signaling by Ang II induces renal microvascular dysfunction and inflammation. Indirect evidence can be obtained using fiber-optic or needle probes to determine relative regional RBF measured by dual-channel laser Doppler flowmetry (Roman and Smits 1986). The myogenic response operates at a frequency of 0.1–0.2 Hz and occurs at approximately 5 s after a rapid increase in arterial pressure, while TGF operates at a frequency of 0.02–0.04 Hz and appears at approximately 25 s after a rapid increase in arterial pressure (Just and Arendshorst 2003). Micropuncture, on the other hand, is useful for assessing TGF in anesthetized rats or mice by measuring proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (PSF; index of glomerular capillary pressure) during manipulation of tubular fluid composition or flow rate to the macula densa (Schnermann et al  1970, Vallon et al  2020). Since development of the in vitro blood-perfused juxtaglomerular nephron (JMN) technique (Casellas and Navar 1984), we and others applied this approach to study renal autoregulation and renal microvascular reactivity in a variety of rat and mouse models (Navar 1978, Inscho et al  1990, 2004a, Carmines et al  1992, Takenaka et al  1994, Guan et al  2009, Sorensen et al  2012, Nagasawa and Imig 2013). Notably, afferent arterioles retain endogenous tone and myogenic and TGF responsiveness (Casellas et al  1985, Moore and Casellas 1990, Takenaka et al  1994, Guan et al  2009). We applied the in vitro blood-perfused rat JMN preparation with papillectomy to eliminate TGF influences, and also found that amiloride or benzamil attenuated pressure-dependent vasoconstriction of rat afferent arterioles (Guan et al  2009). Indeed, the myogenic response was unaffected by amiloride, and actually enhanced by benzamil (Wang et al  2008).ENaC protein and mRNA expression were detected in renal microvessels and freshly isolated preglomerular microvascular smooth muscle cells (MVSMC) from mice and rats (Jernigan and Drummond 2005, 2006, Guan et al  2009). Importantly, mice with reduced β-ENaC expression showed impaired renal myogenic responsiveness, increased mean arterial pressure, and early signs of inflammation and vascular remodeling (Grifoni et al  2010, Drummond et al  2011). The released ATP either acts directly on afferent arterioles via purinergic P2X1 receptors (Bell et al  2003, Inscho et al  2003, 2004a, Inscho 2009) or is catabolized to adenosine which activates A1 receptors to increase afferent arteriolar resistance (Just and Arendshorst 2007, Schnermann 2015, Vallon et al  2020). Renal autoregulation utilizes two primary mechanisms: a local myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) (Inscho 2009, Navar et al  2008, Carlstrom et al  2015, Vallon et al  2020). ATP is an endogenous ligand of P2 receptors and is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo into ADP and AMP by widely expressed extracellular nucleotidases (Burnstock et al  2014, North 2016). Using microdialysis in canine kidneys, Nishiyama et al  (2000, 2001b, 2006) demonstrated a strong positive correlation between renal perfusion pressure and renal interstitial ATP levels but adenosine did not exhibit a similar correlation. Later, several studies (Bell et al  2003, 2009, Peti-Peterdi 2006) using a single glomerulus with attached macula densa and ATP-sensitive biosensor cells provided convincing evidence that ATP was released directly from the basolateral membrane of macula densa cells in response to an increase in luminal NaCl concentration. They observed an immediate increase of cortical tissue ATP levels when perfusion pressure was increased, consistent with Nishiyama’s observations in canine kidneys.
