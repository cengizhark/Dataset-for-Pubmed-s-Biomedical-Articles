PTEN-H was absent from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells with a targeted disruption of the PTEN gene (Fig. Ubc9 was cloned into pcDNA3.1-myc-His-A. Ubc9 and catalytic fragments of SENP1 and SENP2 were cloned into pGEX4T3. Clarified lysates were diluted 10-fold with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor cocktail, then anti-PTEN antibody was added and the mixture was allowed to rotate for 4 hours at 4 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, 5 min each, at room temperature, samples were incubated for 30 min with a 1:400 dilution (in PBS) of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to the fluorescent Alexa 488 dye or with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to the fluorescent Alexa 546 dye (Invitrogen Molecular Probes), washed three times, stained with DAPI and mounted in Mowiol.Cell proliferation assaysCell number was assessed indirectly by using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (2).Phosphorylation reactionsCells were lysed in ATM buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaF, 500 μM NaVO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin), cleared by centrifugation, and subjected to immunoprecipitations with PC116 ATM antibody (Calbiochem). Reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli loading buffer, and samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-SUMO-2/3 antibodies.RNA isolation, reverse transcription PCR, and real-time quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated by using RNeasy (QIAGEN) and treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics). Treatments were initiated when the mean tumor volume in each randomized group (n = 8–10) reached 150 to 200 mm3. For BKM120, treatments were carried out orally, once per day, using an application volume of 10 mL/kg. Indeed, PTEN-H, but not “regular” PTEN reacted with the antibodies to SUMO 2 and SUMO 3 in PTEN immunoprecipitates from human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (Fig. The PTEN K254R mutant retained the ability to counter PI3K signaling as its expression in PTEN-deficient human U87MG glioblastoma cells (6) resulted in comparable decreases in phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) (also called Akt) and of the PKB target GSK3β, as did expression of wt PTEN (Fig. The PTEN signaling network is implicated in the control of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival and migration; processes invariably aberrant in cancer (2–6). Treatment of cells with ionizing radiation (IR) led to loss of nuclear PTEN (Fig. We investigated the DNA damage response (DDR) of U87MG cells, HCT116 cells, and their variants with the PTEN gene disrupted (HCT116 PTEN−/−) (14), engineered to express PTEN wt, K254R, a mutant lacking all phosphatase activity (C124S) or only lipid-phosphatase (G129E) activity, or empty vector control (Fig. However, by 24 hours, 53BP1 foci had largely resolved in wt PTEN- and G129E-reconstituted cells, but not in PTEN-deficient cells, cells lacking nuclear PTEN (K254R) or cells lacking all PTEN phosphatase activity (C124S) (Fig. Consistently, PTEN-deficient cells or cells expressing PTEN K254R, or PTEN C124S, were also defective in resolving phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) and Breast cancer gene 1, early onset (BRCA1) foci (Fig. We monitored the effects of PTEN on radiosensitivity of cells by scoring the surviving fraction of U87MG cells and PTEN−/− MMTC expressing PTEN mutants 5 days after exposure to IR. While PTEN K254R-expressing cells exhibited decreased surviving fraction after IR exposure (Fig. Other forms of genotoxic stress, such as treatment with Cisplatin or Doxorubicin, also led to depletion of SUMO-PTEN, with the timing consistent with appearance of DNA damage elicited by these agents (Fig. By contrast, our results suggest that administering genotoxic agents alone to such tumors could accelerate the acquisition of additional mutations (Fig S16).
