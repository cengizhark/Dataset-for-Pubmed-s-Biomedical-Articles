The current study focuses on the topical delivery of pure 1 and P. barbatus extract on guinea pig and human skin to determine the skin disposition and rates of transport of 1. An in vitro skin diffusion study of pure forskolin (1) versus P. barbatus extract in hairless guinea pig skin and human skin in a flow-through diffusion cell system was conducted. In this study, the diffusion of forskolin was quantified by LC-MS. Representative profiles of the in vitro permeation study of human skin and guinea pig skin treated with pure 1 and P. barbatus extract are shown in Figure 1. The guinea pig skin flux value for pure 1 was 3.4 ± 1.7 nmol/cm2/h with a lag time of 2.8 ± 1.8 h. Unexpectedly, it was found that topical treatment with an equimolar concentration of 1 in P. barbatus extract was significantly different, with flux and lag time values of 18.5 ± 2.3 nmol/cm2/h and 5.5 ± 2.9 h, respectively. Similar differences were observed in human skin; flux values for forskolin from pure 1 and P. barbatus extract were 0.18 ± 0.04 and 3.6 ± 1.0 nmol/cm2/h, with lag times of 1.5 ± 0.6 and 4.8 ± 3.0 h, respectively. As expected in human skin, a tissue more resistant to drug transport, flux values for forskolin (both from pure 1 and from P. barbatus extract) were lower [19-fold for pure 1 (p < 0.001) and 5-fold for P. barbatus extract (p < 0.001)] than the corresponding values in guinea pig skin. The results of these permeation studies showed clearly that 1 (both from the P. barbatus extract and chemically pure 1) can be delivered transdermally, although at different permeation rates through the skin from pure 1 as compared to P. barbatus extract. Skin sections were obtained by using a Padgett dermatome (Integra LifeSciences Corporation; Plainsboro, NJ) set to 250 μm; these sections were stored at −20 °C. Samples were collected in 3 h increments for 24 h. All samples were stored at 4 °C, until analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV and cone voltage set at 25 V, where the source block temperature and desolvation temperature were 120 and 250 °C, respectively. The gradient elution mobile phase initially consisted of 45% A:55% B. The initial 45% mobile phase A was increased linearly to 62% over 10 min, maintained for 1 min, and then decreased linearly to 45% in 1 min and maintained for 8 min. Data Evaluation and Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro permeation data were calculated to assess permeation activity of forskolin on human skin and guinea pig skin treated with pure 1 and P. barbatus extract. Values of 1 flux and skin content treated with P. barbatus extract were compared to those treated with pure 1 on the same type of skin; flux data from the same drug solutions on different skin types were also compared.
