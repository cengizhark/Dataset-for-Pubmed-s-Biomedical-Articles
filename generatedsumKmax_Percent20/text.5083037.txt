The group also reported a trend toward decreased gray matter volume in the temporal lobe accompanied by decreased functional connectivity of the dorsal motor nucleus. Thus, the high-functioning group exhibited deficits in the higher-order association cortex (regarding both functional and structural connectivity), while exhibiting no differences in the primary sensory and motor cortices. Social impairmentSix studies have reported negative correlations between RS connectivity and social impairment in ASD subjects (reported as negative correlations with the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Reciprocal Social Interaction score or ADOS–Social Scale score).19,22,30,31,33,55 The connections involved in four of these studies were between the following: PCC and temporal lobe, posterior parahippocampal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus;31 PCC and right superior frontal gyrus;30 PCC and right medial temporal gyrus;22 and right hemisphere motor cortex and thalamus.55 The other two studies reported negative correlations between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the synchronization between left and right hemisphere inferior frontal gyri,19 and between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the total precuneus connectivity z-scores.33 Kewon and colleagues56 reported a negative correlation between average local degrees of connectivity, the number of other regions to which the ROI connected, and social impairment (reported as a negative correlation with ADOS–Social Scale scores). A study by Assaf and colleagues33 also points toward lower ADOS communication scores with increasing precuneus connectivity z-scores, and Maximo and colleagues46 reported the ADI-R communicative score to be positively correlated with local connectivity within multiple cortical regions.Among the DTI studies, a study by the Nagae group75 reported a negative correlation between mean diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and Clinical Evaluation for Language Fundamentals–4 scores, whereas a study by the Billeci group76 found a similar negative correlation between left arcuate fasciculus mean diffusivity and expressive language ability only in the typically developing group. Given that the ACC and PCC support major connections to the cingulum bundle (and to the adjacent corpus callosum) and have projections into the PFC, superior temporal gyrus, and insula, one can see how these decreases can be interdependent.It has been suggested that increased local connectivity and regional coherence in some brain regions observed in ASD is possibly a result of overcompensation for the reduced long-range connectivity. The most reported ROIs were the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and occipitofrontal fasciculus, with decreased fractional anisotropy (12, 11, and 10 reports, respectively) and increased mean diffusivity (7, 9, and 4 reports, respectively). The most reported ROIs were the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and occipitofrontal fasciculus, with decreased fractional anisotropy (12, 11, and 10 reports, respectively) and increased mean diffusivity (7, 9, and 4 reports, respectively). For example, only two studies reported correlations with social impairment,55,61 and only one study reported any correlation with severity of restricted/repetitive behaviors.87 Even though five studies looked at correlations with language/communication skills, one of these studies looked only at the correlation with local connectivity within different ROIs,86 another at the correlation with the length of streamlines within the superior longitudinal fasciculus,76 and yet another at the correlation with the hemispheric asymmetry quotient.83 Again, while it is possible that structural connectivity changes are predictive and specific for the behavioral profiles in these subjects, the literature has yet to reach a consensus on these matters. RS studies have been documented as having good poolability despite minor variations in acquisition protocols.89 While analysis methods are variable, the major barrier to integrating these findings is the heterogeneity of anatomic localization systems employed and the subsequent lack of reporting of observations from similar pairs of seed and target regions.

In addition, as a spatial average of potentially many discrete directional components that may be present within a voxel, the average direction of the tissue in a voxel may not match any of the specific orientations that reside within. Higher-order techniques for diffusion acquisition and analysis—ones that can resolve multiple directional components within the imaged voxel—are becoming available for use but have yet to become practical for widespread application in studies on autism.

Bulk changes in cerebral hemodynamics associated with changes in neural activity associated with specific tasks can be localized by using well-designed behavioral tasks that tease apart the component functions associated with the specific tasks (task-based fMRI). Since studies of task-based connectivity vary significantly in the tasks used, each focuses on only a specific aspect of ASD connectivity; they are not of general application in this context. By contrast, much research has already been done on RS connectivity, and a basic understanding of the default mode network has been established.

For the DTI studies, results were tabulated to include any change of the white matter properties of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or axial diffusivity as well as the white matter brain regions where these changes were reported as occurring. From these primary tabulations of the literature, we sought to express the observed major findings in a more directly comparable manner. RS fMRIOur literature search for RS fMRI in autism generated 33 studies (Supplemental Table A). Among other reports, PFC and inferior and superior frontal gyrus each had one report of increased, and one report of decreased, local connectivity. PCC, superior temporal sulcus, and precuneous had only one report of decreased local connectivity or regional coherence. PCC, superior temporal sulcus, and precuneous had only one report of decreased local connectivity or regional coherence. The imaging parameters varied widely. The imaging parameters varied widely. The gender ratio also varied widely, from all-male groups to mixed-gender groups. The superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, and corticospinal track had the highest number of mentions among the reports of increased mean diffusivity in ASD (see Supplemental Tables D and E).It is important to note that the Beacher group77 found lower fractional anisotropy only in their Asperger’s male participants compared to typically developing male.
