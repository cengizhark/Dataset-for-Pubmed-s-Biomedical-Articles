Foam cells contribute to the mass of the atherosclerotic plaque and are directly implicated in the development of the necrotic core, a hallmark of plaques vulnerable to rupture [97]. Canakinumab produces a 15% decrease in the primary composite endpoint (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD death) compared to placebo-treated individuals, which is accompanied by 60% reductions in C-Reactive Protein, a risk factor for future CVD events [116]. Conversely, the initiation of atherosclerotic plaque formation that frequently underlies CVD is characterized by deposition of lipoproteins within the vascular intima of arterial walls [10]. Moreover, atherosclerosis remains unchanged with deficiency of Antigen Peptide Transporter 1 (TAP-1), an essential component of the MHC class I presentation complex that participates in cross-presentation [142]. Subsequently, these lipoproteins undergo oxidation in the subendothelial space, which recruits inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and DCs into the plaque via damage-associated molecular patterns [11,12]. Thus, immune checkpoint blockade may have unintended consequences in treating individuals with CVD and cancer, and conversely, PD-1 agonists may prove beneficial in CVD [154].Additional interactions between costimulatory molecules, such as CD40/CD40L and OX40/OX40L may mediate interactions between antigen-presenting monocytes and T cells. Thus, immune checkpoint blockade may have unintended consequences in treating individuals with CVD and cancer, and conversely, PD-1 agonists may prove beneficial in CVD [154].Additional interactions between costimulatory molecules, such as CD40/CD40L and OX40/OX40L may mediate interactions between antigen-presenting monocytes and T cells. Clinical trials targeting interactions between CD40 and CD40L in atherosclerosis were discontinued due to thrombotic complications; nevertheless, an antisense oligonucleotide approach targeting CD40 may represent a promising approach [149,158]. While there have been no clinical trials on these targets to date, an anti-OX40 antagonistic antibody that elicits increased OX40+ T cells is currently under trial for individuals with solid tumors [160].

In response to the inflammatory signaling initiated by monocyte-derived cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate the plaque, where they further agonize plaque destabilization and increase the risk of myocardial infarction [12].

In response to the inflammatory signaling initiated by monocyte-derived cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate the plaque, where they further agonize plaque destabilization and increase the risk of myocardial infarction [12]. These methods have been championed in the cancer field, revealing novel insight into potential immunotherapeutic targets in the cancer setting [36,52,162]. Plaque-resident macrophages from asymptomatic individuals express IL1B, predicted to bind to IL1RAP, which encodes a component of the IL-1 receptor complex expressed by T cells [152]. Monocytes have traditionally been classified into classical, nonclassical, and intermediate subsets, and this framework has provided the basis for functional studies to date. NR4A1 expression is controlled by the transcription factors KLF2 and C/EBPβ [5], but additional studies are needed to identify the signals driving this genetic program. Furthermore, the anti-tumoral activity of CCR2 inhibition in mice bearing Hepa1–6 liver tumors requires the presence of CD8+ T cells [50]. In renal cell carcinoma specifically, transcripts associated with downstream activation of T cells, such as TNF, IL1B, IL6, and CCL3, are elevated [55]. Blockade of monocyte recruitment via CCR2 inhibition reduces macrophage-based production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-13, IL-15, and TNFɑ that can differentially impact T cell responses [50,57,58]. These observations warrant the continued exploration of Treg-monocyte interactions and potential for therapeutic targeting within the TIME. Antigen PresentationCross-presentation is particularly important for immune responses against tumor cells that express a high number of mutations but lack the machinery necessary for priming T cells directly.

Interestingly, tumor antigen in metastatic lung sites is redirected from macrophages to cDCs in CCR2-deficient mice, indicating that different APCs may compete for tumor antigen [44].

Monocytes upregulate both the PD-L1/2 and CD80/CD86 pathways as they enter the TIME and differentiate into TAMs [76]. Monocytes upregulate both the PD-L1/2 and CD80/CD86 pathways as they enter the TIME and differentiate into TAMs [76]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and PD-L1/2 have been highly successful in subsets of non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and other solid tumor patients [79], but whether these therapies inhibit monocyte-T cell interactions remains unclear. Classical Ly6Chi monocytes (Table 1, Figure 2) represent the first immune cell population to arrive at the atherosclerotic plaque via recruitment by CCR2-CCL2, CX3CR1-CX3CL1, and CCR5-CCL5 signaling [84,85].
