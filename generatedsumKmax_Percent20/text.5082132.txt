Hoechst easily detected condensed or fragmented nuclei and the vital probe propidium iodide excluded necrotic cells with damaged cell membranes. Phiphilux is a new generation cell permeable probe which emits fluorescence in the red (G2D2) or green (G1D2) when cleaved by active caspase 3. In some studies we used an Olympus FV1000-MPE confocal/multiphoton microscope equipped with a Spectra Physics MaiTai Deep See laser and gallium arsenide 12-bit detectors. At these later time points, Phiphilux signal could be seen in a small punctate subapical pattern that partially co-localized with the green autofluorescence signal (inset in Fig. In Figure 3, we followed the Phiphilux signal in a sham wild-type kidney volume over a 2 hour time period, imaging intermittently every 30 minutes. Ischemia reperfusion is known to induce caspase 3 activation and apoptosis in S2 and S3 renal tubules.11 To determine whether this can be detected by Phiphilux, we imaged the kidney of a wild-type mouse after 40 minutes of ischemia. However, within 30 minutes after reperfusion, some Phiphilux signal could be detected in S2 tubular cells (Fig. Sixty minutes following reperfusion, Phiphilux positive S2 cells with condensed nuclei suggestive of apoptosis could be easily detected in random fields (Fig. That this Phiphilux signal in apoptotic S2 cells is indeed a read-out of caspase 3 activity could theoretically be confirmed by performing the ischemia reperfusion experiment in caspase 3 KO mice.
