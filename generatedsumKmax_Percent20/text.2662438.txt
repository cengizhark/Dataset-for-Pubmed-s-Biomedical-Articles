HPLC (Agilent 1100) experimental conditions were as follows: C18 column (15 cm × 0.4), 60% acetonitrile plus 25 mM HOAc/H2O as mobile phase, 1.5 mL/min flow rate, UV detection at λ = 320 nm. Silica gel (GF245 and 200–400 mesh) was purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd for TLC, PTLC, and column chromatography. 7-Acetoxy-3,4-dimethylcoumarin (7)3,4-Dimethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (6) (19.0 g, 100 mmol) in acetic anhydride (50 mL) was heated to reflux for 1.5 h. After cooling to 50 °C, the reaction mixture was slowly poured into ice-water (300 mL) with vigorous stirring. 7-Acetoxy-3,4-dimethylcoumarin (7)3,4-Dimethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (6) (19.0 g, 100 mmol) in acetic anhydride (50 mL) was heated to reflux for 1.5 h. After cooling to 50 °C, the reaction mixture was slowly poured into ice-water (300 mL) with vigorous stirring. The mixture was then heated slowly to 110 °C and kept at the same temperature for 1 h to produce a suspension. Subsequently, another promising candidate 3-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-DCK (3, HMDCK) showed moderate bioavailabity, but lacked activity in a drug resistant strain.8 Guided by SAR and 3D-QSAR results,9 our research efforts next focused on the development of drug candidates with better pharmacokinetic profiles and potent anti HIV-1 drug-resistant activity. The crude product could be used in the next reaction without further purification. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed successively with 10% aq HCl, water and brine. 3-Cyanomethyl-4-methyl-3',4'-di-O-(S)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (4)A solution of sodium cyanide (0.69 g, 14 mmol) in 40 mL of 95% EtOH was cooled in an ice-bath. 18H, 6×CH3), 1.46 and 1.49 (each s, 3H, 2'-CH3), 1.66, 1.91, 2.18, and 2.51 (each m, 2×CH2), 2.52 (s, 3H, 4-CH3), 3.72 (s, 2H, 3-CH2), 5.40 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 3'-H), 6.65 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 4'-H), 6.89 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 6-ArH), 7.62 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 5-ArH); 13C NMR δ ppm 9.6 and 9.9 (2×CH3), 15.7 (3-CH2), 16.3, 16.4, 16.6, and 16.7 (4×CH3), 21.2 (2×CH3) and 26.1 (4-CH3), 28.9, 29.0, 30.9, and 31.3 (4×CH2), 54.6, 54.7, 54.9, and 55.1 (4×C), 61.5 and 72.1 (2×CH), 112.8 (CN), 90.7, 91.3, 106.3, 113.3, 116.3 (6×C), 114.9 and 127.2 (2×CH), 150.6, 152.2, 156.7, 159.2, 167.0, 167.4 (6×C), 177.4 and 178.6 (C=O); IR cm−1 (KBr): 2972, 2935; MS (ESI) m/z (%): 676.5 ([M+1]+, 100), 693.5 (M+NH4+,48), 698.5 (M+Na+,75). 18H, 6×CH3), 1.46 and 1.49 (each s, 3H, 2'-CH3), 1.66, 1.91, 2.18, and 2.51 (each m, 2×CH2), 2.52 (s, 3H, 4-CH3), 3.72 (s, 2H, 3-CH2), 5.40 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 3'-H), 6.65 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 4'-H), 6.89 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 6-ArH), 7.62 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 5-ArH); 13C NMR δ ppm 9.6 and 9.9 (2×CH3), 15.7 (3-CH2), 16.3, 16.4, 16.6, and 16.7 (4×CH3), 21.2 (2×CH3) and 26.1 (4-CH3), 28.9, 29.0, 30.9, and 31.3 (4×CH2), 54.6, 54.7, 54.9, and 55.1 (4×C), 61.5 and 72.1 (2×CH), 112.8 (CN), 90.7, 91.3, 106.3, 113.3, 116.3 (6×C), 114.9 and 127.2 (2×CH), 150.6, 152.2, 156.7, 159.2, 167.0, 167.4 (6×C), 177.4 and 178.6 (C=O); IR cm−1 (KBr): 2972, 2935; MS (ESI) m/z (%): 676.5 ([M+1]+, 100), 693.5 (M+NH4+,48), 698.5 (M+Na+,75). 18H, 6×CH3), 1.46 and 1.49 (each s, 3H, 2'-CH3), 1.66, 1.91, 2.18, and 2.51 (each m, 2×CH2), 2.52 (s, 3H, 4-CH3), 3.72 (s, 2H, 3-CH2), 5.40 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 3'-H), 6.65 (d, 1H, J = 4.8 Hz, 4'-H), 6.89 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 6-ArH), 7.62 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, 5-ArH); 13C NMR δ ppm 9.6 and 9.9 (2×CH3), 15.7 (3-CH2), 16.3, 16.4, 16.6, and 16.7 (4×CH3), 21.2 (2×CH3) and 26.1 (4-CH3), 28.9, 29.0, 30.9, and 31.3 (4×CH2), 54.6, 54.7, 54.9, and 55.1 (4×C), 61.5 and 72.1 (2×CH), 112.8 (CN), 90.7, 91.3, 106.3, 113.3, 116.3 (6×C), 114.9 and 127.2 (2×CH), 150.6, 152.2, 156.7, 159.2, 167.0, 167.4 (6×C), 177.4 and 178.6 (C=O); IR cm−1 (KBr): 2972, 2935; MS (ESI) m/z (%): 676.5 ([M+1]+, 100), 693.5 (M+NH4+,48), 698.5 (M+Na+,75). Moreover, it is also a good H-bond acceptor and can favorably interact with Tyr or Ser amino-acid residues on the NNRTI binding site surface, which are critical determinants for several NNRTIs affinities.10 In addition, reported evidence suggests that by introducing a cyano group, such as seen with the potent anti-HIV drug etravirine, the binding affinity of a quinazoline inhibitor to its target (containing Tyr30 and Tyr50) increased dramatically by 30,000-fold, due to hydrogen bond formation between the cyano nitrogen and two phenol hydroxyls of two tyrosines.11 Based on the aforementioned evidence, the 3-cyanomethyl moiety was selected to replace the 3-hydroxymethyl group of 3. Detection of HIV-1 replication as measured by p24 antigen productionMT-2 and MT-4 cells, laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains and primary HIV-1 isolates were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The cells were cultured in 75 cm2 plastic flasks at 37 °C for 2 h. The non-adherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells in 10 mL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and 100 U/mL IL-2 (Sigma), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 days. The supernatants were collected seven days post-infection and tested for p24 antigen by ELISA as described above. Acetonitrile was HPLC grade and other chemical reagents and solvents were of analytical grade. The final concentrations of standards were set to 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 1000, 2000, and 5000 ng/mL. As stated above, because 4 is a good potential drug candidate for preclinical studies, a practical synthesis for scale-up of 4 is merited and has been developed. The total yield of 4 was significantly increased from 7.8% in the original seven-step synthesis6 to 32% in the new ten-step synthesis with optimized conditions, as shown in Scheme 1 and Table 1. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min (Figure 2) and were immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma fractions. The plasma samples obtained were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Data for each pharmacokinetic parameter were averaged and reported as mean ± standard deviation. The monolayers were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator with pre-warmed transport media. Testing compounds at final concentrations of 10 mM in HBSS were added to the apical compartment. Condensation of 8 with acetone in the presence of pyrrolidine yielded the fused angular pyranocoumarin 9 in an 81% yield. Additionally, this modified route to the key intermediate 11 has additional advantages for scale-up synthesis: it avoids production of the linear isomer, does not require chromatographic purification, and eliminates use of the costly reagent 3-chloro-3-methylbutyne-1 and the environmental contaminant N,N-diethylaniline. Compound 12 was treated with N-bromosuccinimide at a mole ratio of 1:1.2 in refluxing benzene for 4 h to produce exclusively 3-bromomethyl-4-methyl-DCK (13)4, 6 in 97% yield. In addition to 1H NMR shifts, the position of bromination was verified using NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) measurement, in which the signals of a methyl singlet (2.41 ppm, s) and 6-proton (6.80 ppm, d, J = 8.8 Hz) showed obviously increased response of ca. However, increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART regimens fail to respond to current antiretroviral drugs due to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants.1 Therefore, it is essential to develop additional potent anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action or resistance profiles different from those of current anti-HIV therapeutics. We investigated the impact of various solvents and phase-transfer catalysts as shown in Table 2 to find a better solvent system. 3.5:1, which indicated that the product was a pair of isomers. The former conditions provided only one product (3-CH2 signal at δ 3.72 ppm) and the latter conditions afforded the other product (3-CH2 signal at δ 5.27 ppm) in 1H NMR spectrum. Other phase-transfer catalysts, including benzyltriethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylammonium chloride, dibenzo-18-crown-6, and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, were also investigated in the two-phase reaction system (data not shown), but Bu4N+I− gave better results. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis by using DAS Version 2.0. Meanwhile, compound 4 also showed low systemic clearance (0.052 L/min/kg) and a moderate half time (167 min). The modified synthesis gave a high overall yield of 32%, with minimized isomer formation, simplified purification, and elimination of high-cost reagents and toxic solvents, thus providing clear advantages for further scale-up synthesis.
