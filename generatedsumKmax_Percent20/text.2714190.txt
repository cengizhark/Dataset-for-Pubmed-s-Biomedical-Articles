Coronal sections of the cerebral cortex showed midline fusion of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. The development of hydrocephalus in WWS has been attributed to several factors, including stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct and blockage of the arachnoid granulations by glial/neuronal heterotopia (Dobyns et al , 1989). 5J, asterisk).Although almost all of the MORE-DG null mice showed complete loss of dystroglycan expression in the brain, one of the mice showed mosaic dystroglycan expression and developed milder pathology than mice with more complete loss of dystroglycan expression. Interestingly, the cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex was relatively preserved at sites of residual dystroglycan expression, although adjacent portions of the cerebral cortex that lacked expression of dystroglycan were dysplastic. The microphthalmic eyes presented small or absent lenses (Fig. The loss of dystroglycan expression in the lens, cornea, and iris was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (supplemental Fig. This study examined the expression and function of dystroglycan in the WWS CNS and the effect of dystroglycan loss on the development of the mouse brain and eye. On immunoblot of WWS brain, we detected a reduced molecular weight of α-dystroglycan (∼90 kDa) similar to what has been observed in skeletal muscle (Kim et al , 2004), indicating the disruption of a common step in the posttranslational processing of α-dystroglycan. The mutation may be present outside the coding region of one of the known causative genes or it may lie in an unknown gene in the biosynthetic pathway of dystroglycan. In addition, it drives expression of Cre recombinase throughout the entire mouse epiblast, whereas the GFAP-Cre transgene restricts expression to radial glia and astrocytes, silencing dystroglycan in these cells and a subset of neurons that are the progeny of radial glia (Tallquist and Soriano, 2000; Zhuo et al , 2001). The amplicons generated were purified and directly sequenced with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). POMT1 and LARGE were sequenced by PreventionGenetics. In an alternative breeding strategy, we bred heterozygous mice (Dag1lox/+) carrying the Mox2-Cre transgene (Cre-Dag1lox/+) with Dag1lox/− mice to obtain Cre-Dag1lox/− and mice homozygous for Dag1lox carrying the Mox2-Cre transgene (Cre-Dag1lox/lox). In an alternative breeding strategy, we bred heterozygous mice (Dag1lox/+) carrying the Mox2-Cre transgene (Cre-Dag1lox/+) with Dag1lox/− mice to obtain Cre-Dag1lox/− and mice homozygous for Dag1lox carrying the Mox2-Cre transgene (Cre-Dag1lox/lox).

Identical results were obtained by both breeding strategies. Identical results were obtained by both breeding strategies. The solubilized fraction was incubated with WGA-agarose beads (Vector Labs) for 24 h. The beads were then washed with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and the bound protein was eluted with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 300 mmN-acetyl d-glucosamine. Adult or embryonic tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5 µm sections were cut on an RM2135 microtome (Leica). For immunofluorescence, 3- to 4-week-old brains and eyes were fresh frozen in isopentane cooled by dry ice, and 8 µm sections were cut on a CM3050S cryostat (Leica). AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used: IIH6 (1:100) (Ervasti and Campbell, 1993), AP83 (1:100) (Duclos et al , 1998),Sheep5 (1:100) (Michele et al , 2002; Barresi et al , 2004), anti-laminin (1:1000) (Sigma L9393), anti-perlecan (1:1000) (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents MAB1948), and anti-calbindin (1:1000) (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents AB1778).

The clinical history of the donor included hypotonia and muscle weakness, microphthalmia and cataract of the left eye, agyria, and hydrocephalus affecting all ventricles (Kanoff et al , 1998). The reactivity of the IIH6 antibody is dependent on the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, and its epitope is lost after chemical deglycosylation (Ervasti and Campbell, 1993). Laminin binding is also lost after chemical deglycosylation, and it is blocked by competition with the IIH6 antibody (Ervasti and Campbell, 1993). The specificity of the assay was confirmed by laminin overlay on immunoblots of α-dystroglycan purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and WGA-enriched extracts of human brain (Fig. At this stage of development, dystroglycan is normally present at the basement membrane between the visceral endoderm and ectoderm. Despite the loss of dystroglycan from this basement membrane, the epiblast and proamniotic cavity had normal histology.Crosses between floxed-dystroglycan and Mox2-Cre mouse strains generated MORE-DG null mice at a 12% frequency corresponding to half the predicted Mendelian ratio (25%). We confirmed the loss of dystroglycan expression in the MORE-DG null brain by immunoblot of WGA-enriched homogenates of whole brain (Fig. We confirmed the loss of dystroglycan expression in the MORE-DG null brain by immunoblot of WGA-enriched homogenates of whole brain (Fig. The integrity of these basement membranes was examined by immunofluorescence detection of laminin and perlecan.
