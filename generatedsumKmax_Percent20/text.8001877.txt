NCI+ status was associated with African American race, eGRF > 60 ml/min, lack of alcohol use, higher hemoglobin level, and lower albumin levels. The FA of the right tapetum was significantly lower in the NCI+ group compared with the NCI− group. Six GM regions in the left hemisphere and nine in the right hemisphere were selected. However, existing screening tools poorly distinguish NCI+ from NCI− in adults with HIV due to low sensitivity and/or specificity. Compared with the current NCI screening tools for patients with HIV, the proposed model combining clinical and MRI features is more promising with both high sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.86; specificity: 0.71). Findings of this study show that involving MRI features in the machine learning model substantially elevated specificity without any attenuation of sensitivity. When examining GM, Adeli et al  found HIV-specific impairment of brain regions including the parahippocampal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior frontal gyrus using Chained-Regularization within a multiple kernel learning framework (Adeli et al  2018). Our study was only based on neuropsychological assessments and MRI, which did not assess daily functional impairment and long-term outcomes. Third, although commonly used in research and clinical settings, the GDS has been shown to over-diagnose NCI in people with HIV (Carey et al  2004a; De Francesco et al  2016; Gisslen et al  2011; Heaton et al  1995; Heaton et al  1994; Underwood et al  2018). There are two main approaches for implementing machine learning: unsupervised and supervised learning (Libbrecht et al  2015). In unsupervised machine learning, characterized by clustering, algorithms seek to learn structure in the data without the benefit of labels (e.g., diagnoses). This analysis included people who were 18–55 years old. As part of the original protocols, participants were excluded for 2 or more days of use of any illicit drug other than cocaine and marijuana. T-scores for each test were converted to a deficit score ranging from 0 to 5 with 0 representing no impairment and 5 representing severe impairment (Carey et al  2004). Previous studies have found that a GDS cutoff score of 0.5 yields the most optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity and the best discriminatory power in predicting NCI among people with HIV (Carey et al  2004; Heaton et al  2004). A dichotomized GDS was used to establish the SVM model because the neuropsychological physicians usually diagnose a patient as “impaired” or “not impaired.” Results based on dichotomized GDS are meant especially for clinical diagnosis. Using this information, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 2.0 was computed to provide a summary of the overall HIV disease burden (Marquine et al  2014). Protocol 1 used parameters: b-factor = 900 s/mm2, TR/TE = 10,000/83.2 ms, 73 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 2 used parameters: b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/77.9 ms and 78.2 ms, 67 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 3 used parameters b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/78.6 ms, 67 slices, 80 directions. Protocol 1 used parameters: b-factor = 900 s/mm2, TR/TE = 10,000/83.2 ms, 73 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 2 used parameters: b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/77.9 ms and 78.2 ms, 67 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 3 used parameters b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/78.6 ms, 67 slices, 80 directions. Anatomical data were analyzed with FSL-VBM (Douaud et al  2007, http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM), an optimized VBM protocol (Good et al  2001) carried out with FSL tools (Smith et al  2004). GM images were then segmented into regions using the Havard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases within FSL. The averaged GM volume within each segmented cortical and subcortical region was then extracted using fslmeants (Jenkinson et al  2012).For the DWI data, all cases were run through a denoising procedure that substantially improves signal quality by reducing non-Gaussian noise-induced signal bias while maintaining anatomic resolvability (Chen et al  2018). HAND is diagnosed based on comprehensive neuropsychological testing that assesses performance in different cognitive domains and is defined by NCI in at least two domains (Antinori et al  2007). First, B1 bias-correction was performed to correct for field inhomogeneity using dwibiascorrect in MRtrix3 and the ANTS N4 method for estimating the bias field (Tustison et al  2010). White matter (WM) images were then segmented into regions using the ICBM-DTI-81 WM label atlas within FSL. The averaged WM volume within each segmented tract was then extracted using fslmeants (Jenkinson et al  2012). In addition to requiring specialized training, neuropsychological testing batteries are relatively time-consuming to implement, language- and education-dependent, and susceptible to contextual influences (e.g., sleepiness, effort level, time of day) (Benloucif et al  2004; Seelye et al  2015). Modeling was also performed using other kernels with no improvement of classification (Appendix Table 1). Sample characteristicsThe characteristics of the 101 participants are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was 41.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 9.6); the majority of the participants were male (73.3%) and African American (81.2%).
