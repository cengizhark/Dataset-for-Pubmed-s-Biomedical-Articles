Holistically addressing such issues among MCSM, in addition to problematic drug use patterns, could impact levels of involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours – and DVL – among this and other marginalised groups. For example, Aidala et al ’s [9] systematic review of evidence on associations between housing status and health outcomes among people living with HIV indicated that unstable or insecure accommodation had a significant impact on numerous HIV outcomes including appropriate medical care, sustained viral suppression, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and risk of forward transmission. Questionnaire design & administrationThe structured behavioural survey is undertaken via computer-assisted self-interview and collects information across domains including: participant sociodemographics, substance use, sexual behaviours, lifestyle conditions (e.g., accommodation, social involvement), HIV testing and treatment history, and utilisation of drug treatment and health and support services. Questionnaire design & administrationThe structured behavioural survey is undertaken via computer-assisted self-interview and collects information across domains including: participant sociodemographics, substance use, sexual behaviours, lifestyle conditions (e.g., accommodation, social involvement), HIV testing and treatment history, and utilisation of drug treatment and health and support services. Participants reporting a race other than Hispanic/Latino/Spanish, African American/black or Caucasian/white were excluded from the analyses (n=36; Table 1).Firstly, to assess the possible additive effects of experiencing multiple indicators of social disadvantage/marginalisation, the number of specified syndemic conditions was summed for participants at each time-point (i.e., ranging from zero to four) and included in a GEE analysis with sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours as the dependent variable, controlling for age, race and last partner type (i.e., main/regular partner, friend/acquaintance, or one-time/unknown/’trade’ partner).Secondly, we constructed multivariate GEE models (using an exchangeable correlation structure due to the underlying assumption that outcomes from the same subject are correlated over follow-up) to explore associations between exposures and outcomes over the follow-up period and generate profiles of participants classified as experiencing high levels of social disadvantage/marginalisation (i.e., a greater number of syndemic conditions). The same GEE model was conducted alternating each of the syndemic conditions and involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours as the dependent variable, and controlling for age, HIV status, race, key drug use variables significant at a bivariate level, and last partner type. Identifying and combating factors that explain discrepancies across races and ethnicities linked to HIV transmission among MSM generally could help to reduce HIV incidence and prevalence in LAC and nationwide. Multivariate analyses: Number of syndemic conditions reported vs. key outcomesTable 2 shows that, when controlling for participant age and race and last partner type, reporting a greater number (i.e., two or more) of structural syndemic conditions was significantly associated with reporting sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among HIV-negative respondents [two conditions: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.30; ≥3 conditions: AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.37), and having a DVL among the HIV-positive group (vs. not having a DVL) (two conditions: AOR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11–1.42; ≥3 conditions: 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09–1.52). In this context, numerous studies have investigated the contribution of syndemic factors – two or more synergistic or additive conditions that interact to adversely impact disease trajectories [3, 4] – on HIV transmission among MSM. Our study did point to an additive effect in that experiencing more structural syndemic conditions was associated with significantly higher odds of both HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants engaging in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours with their last anal sex partner, and of HIV-positive participants having a DVL. This underscores the value of simultaneously considering multiple structural and other systemic issues – such as unemployment, homelessness and engagement with the healthcare system – when developing and implementing initiatives to address HIV transmission among marginalised MCSM, especially in the context of problematic substance use. However, race was not significantly associated with any other outcomes, suggesting that experience of the structural disparities investigated in this research is an important contributor to involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among MCSM generally. Multi-faceted initiatives encompassing prevention, harm reduction and treatment approaches are urgently required to prevent and reduce methamphetamine use and associated outcomes – including the transmission of blood-borne viruses such as HIV – among MCSM in LAC. Further analyses showed that this finding was not dictated by age or any particular race (data not shown), suggesting that additional barriers are preventing such men from accessing appropriate professional support. It is possible that involvement in the study served as a de facto intervention which impacted participants’ involvement in predictors and outcomes of interest (e.g., substance use, sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours) over the follow-up period.
