Clinical data were obtained by direct examination of participants, review of medical records, and structured questionnaires.Variant identificationUW samples: Individuals affected by JBTS were previously screened using a molecular inversion probes (MIPs) targeted capture,4,9 covering AHI1 (MIM: 608894), ARL13B (MIM: 608922), ARMC9 (MIM:617612), B9D1 (MIM: 614144), B9D2 (MIM: 611951), C2CD3 (MIM: 615944), CPLANE1 (MIM: 614571), CC2D2A (MIM: 612013), CEP290 (MIM: 61042), CEP41 (MIM: 610523), CSPP1 (MIM: 611654), IFT172 (MIM: 607386), INPP5E (MIM: 613037), KIF7 (MIM: 611254), MKS1 (MIM: 609883), NPHP1 (MIM: 607100), OFD1 (MIM: 300170), RPGRIP1L (MIM: 610937), TCTN1 (MIM: 609863), TCTN2 (MIM: 613846), TCTN3 (MIM: 613847), TMEM138 (MIM: 614459), TMEM216 (MIM: 613277), TMEM231 (MIM: 614949), TMEM237 (MIM: 614423), TMEM67 (MIM: 609884), TOGARAM1 (MIM: 617618), TTC21B (MIM: 612014), and ZNF423 (MIM: 604557).In samples without biallelic rare, predicted-deleterious variants (RDVs), exome sequencing was performed as previously described10 using Roche Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 capture probes (36.5 Mb of coding exons) and paired-end 50 bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. We used SeattleSeq for variant annotation and the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score to determine deleteriousness of identified missense variants.11 Based on CADD score data for causal variants in other JBTS-associated genes, we used a CADD score cutoff of 15 to define deleterious variants.4CUMC family: Research trio analysis was performed as previously described.12 In brief, DNA samples were exome sequenced by the Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center. Variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01 were excluded, and variants that were predicted pathogenic by American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines were prioritized.13 The TMEM218 variants were validated by Sanger sequencing.RUMC family: After a gene panel analysis for vision disorders failed to identify biallelic RDVs, clinical exome sequencing revealed the TMEM218 variants reported in this work. The TMEM218 variants were validated by Sanger sequencing.AUMC family: After clinical exome sequencing with a ciliopathy panel of 142 genes failed to identify biallelic RDVs, clinical exome sequencing identified the pathogenic TMEM218 variants reported here. We then screened our cohort (i.e., 62 individuals with JBTS who had not been sequenced and 229 individuals with JBTS who had been previously sequenced but whose genetic etiology was unknown) using small molecule molecular inversion probes capture4,9,20 and identifiedg.124967612G>A (GenBank: NC_000011.9) (c.343C>T [GenBank: NM_001258243.1];p.Arg115Cys [GenBank: NP_001245172.1]) homozygous in a fetus diagnosed with Meckel syndrome (UW363–3) (Figure 1; Table 1). Two fetuses (UW363–3 and AUMC-1) had polydactyly and polycystic kidneys in addition to occipital encephalocele, warranting a Meckel syndrome diagnosis (Table 1). The presence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in one fetus may indicate an increased risk for congenital heart defects, which should prompt a low threshold for echocardiogram, particularly if adequate cardiac views were not obtained by prenatal ultrasound. Based on the genetic and phenotypic overlap, Joubert and Meckel syndromes likely represent the milder and more severe ends, respectively, of a ciliopathy spectrum. Here the TZ partitions the cilium from the cytoplasm by regulating ciliary protein content and serving as a bi-directional diffusion barrier. The JBTS-associated proteins localize to multiple subregions of the cilium, but the TZ is a hotspot for ciliopathy-related proteins, and indeed, half of the JS-associated proteins localize to the region. At the utmost periphery sits another distinct module, consisting of B9D1, B9D2, and several transmembrane proteins, including TMEM218 (also TMEM216, TMEM231, TMEM80, TMEM17, and TMEM237).8 It is enticing to speculate that TMEM218 could be part of the ciliary necklace, a series of 3 rows of particles that encircle the cilium near the base, first observed by freeze-etch scanning electron microscopy of cilia in the mid-20th century.32 Given its role in ciliary biology and association with so many ciliopathy-related proteins, Li et al 8 also predicted that deleterious variants in this gene would cause ciliopathies. This finding is supported by functional work localizing TMEM218 to the ciliary TZ and a mouse model recapitulating the retinal and kidney phenotypes.
