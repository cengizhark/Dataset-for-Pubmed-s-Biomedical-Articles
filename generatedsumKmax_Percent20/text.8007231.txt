The fluorescent images were taken right after microsphere fabrication using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200) to avoid the diffusion of fluorescent dyes. In brief, 50 mg of oxygen-release microspheres were mixed with 6 mL catalase solution (5 mg/mL in DI water), and stirred for 4 h at 4 °C.

In brief, 50 mg of oxygen-release microspheres were mixed with 6 mL catalase solution (5 mg/mL in DI water), and stirred for 4 h at 4 °C. The mixture was placed in a 37 °C incubator for gelation. The double stranded DNA (dsDNA) content was measured using a PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher). The constructs were loaded into EPR tubes (n = 3 for each group). The tubes were placed in a hypoxic incubator (1% O2, 37 °C) for 48 h. The EPR tests were performed on an X-band EPR instrument (Bruker), with 0.1 mW for microwave power, 1.0 dB for attenuation, 9.8 GHz for frequency, and 1.5 for modulation amplitude [52].

The EPR tests were performed on an X-band EPR instrument (Bruker), with 0.1 mW for microwave power, 1.0 dB for attenuation, 9.8 GHz for frequency, and 1.5 for modulation amplitude [52]. Six mice were used for each group. At days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28, the blood perfusion of the normal and surgery hindlimbs was measured using a laser Doppler perfusion imager (Perimed). The blood flow recovery percentage was calculated by normalizing the blood perfusion intensity in the ischemic hindlimb to the normal hindlimb in the same animal [55]. Cell density was then quantified from the images. Muscle fiber diameter, and density of central nucleus in muscle fibers were quantified based on the H&E images. For immunohistochemical analysis, the tissue sections were first stained with antialpha smooth muscle actin-alpha (α-SMA, Abcam), isolectin (Thermo Fisher), anti-Ki67 (Thermo Fisher), anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC, R&D) and anti-F4/80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The tissue sections were then incubated with corresponding Dylight488-anti mouse and 647-anti rabbit secondary antibodies. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. The PNHAM was made by free radical polymerization of NIPAAm, HEMA, AOLA and NAS (Fig. The molar ratio of the four components was calculated as NIPAAm/HEMA/AOLA/NAS = 52.5/4.4/22.3/20.8 (Fig. PNHAN was conjugated with NIEM via the succinimide-amine reaction (Fig. The conjugation was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrum where the characteristic peak of NAS at 2.8 ppm became unpronounced after conjugation (Fig. With the increase of NI content from 9% to 18%, the water content of the polymers in hypoxia appeared to have increased, although statistical significance was not reached. The polymer had 30.7% weight loss after 8 weeks in normoxic environment. The ratio of PNHAN and PNHAN/NI18 were modulated to allow the shell to have NI content of 5% and 16%, respectively. The combined effects of water content and degradation rate possibly resulted in accelerated release of oxygen. During the 4-week release study period, the release medium contained less than 10 μM H2O2 as measured by a peroxide assay kit. This hydrogel has been confirmed to be injectable and biocompatible [41,51]. The constructs were cultured under hypoxic condition (1% O2) without supplement of FBS. These results demonstrate that the enhanced cell survival under hypoxia was resulted from increased intracellular oxygen content. It remains to be investigated whether the released oxygen changes cell metabolic behaviors, such as oxygen consumption rate, glycolysis rate and fatty acid oxidation under hypoxia.One of the concerns for released oxygen is that it may increase ROS content in MSCs leading to cell death. To address this limitation, we have recently developed novel oxygen-release microspheres (ORM) based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/H2O2 complex, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and catalase [41–43]. Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects more than 200 million people worldwide, is a progressive atherosclerotic disorder induced mainly by the lipid deposition in the vascular bed as a result of hardening and narrowing of arteries [1]. Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects more than 200 million people worldwide, is a progressive atherosclerotic disorder induced mainly by the lipid deposition in the vascular bed as a result of hardening and narrowing of arteries [1]. Besides bFGF and PDGFBB, the Gel/MSC/ORM group also had significantly greater HGF expression (p < 0.001), whereas the Gel/MSC, Surgery and Gel groups had similar expression (p > 0.05). The above results reveal that the released oxygen significantly promoted MSC paracrine effects. The blood perfusion in the Surgery group was slowly increased during the 4-week experimental period with 41% blood perfusion at week 4 (Fig. The fastest blood flow recovery was found for the Gel/MSC/ORM group where both MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres were encapsulated in the hydrogel (Fig. The fastest blood flow recovery was found for the Gel/MSC/ORM group where both MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres were encapsulated in the hydrogel (Fig. The fastest blood flow recovery was found for the Gel/MSC/ORM group where both MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres were encapsulated in the hydrogel (Fig. The fastest blood flow recovery was found for the Gel/MSC/ORM group where both MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres were encapsulated in the hydrogel (Fig. The fastest blood flow recovery was found for the Gel/MSC/ORM group where both MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres were encapsulated in the hydrogel (Fig. It remains to be investigated whether delivery of MSCs and oxygen-release microspheres promoted the formation of functional vessels in ischemic limbs, which can be determined by performing vascular perfusion with fluorescent-labeled lectin following by visualizing the functional blood vessels. The injection of Gel/MSC and Gel/MSC/ORM promoted skeletal muscle regeneration, as the muscle fiber diameter was significantly increased compared to the Surgery and Gel groups (p < 0.001. Consistent with muscle fiber results, the central nucleus density was remarkably greater in the Gel/MSC/ORM group than other groups (Fig. It is speculated that the enhanced MSC paracrine effects, and improved survival of skeletal muscle cells by released oxygen accelerated myogenesis. The injection of Gel group, Gel/MSC group, and Gel/MSC/ORM group did not augment tissue inflammation as these groups had similar density of F4/80+ macrophages as the Surgery group (p > 0.05). The injection of Gel group, Gel/MSC group, and Gel/MSC/ORM group did not augment tissue inflammation as these groups had similar density of F4/80+ macrophages as the Surgery group (p > 0.05). The reaction was conducted at 80 °C for 4 h followed by overnight stirring at room temperature. The chemical structure of NIEM was confirmed by 1H NMR ((CD3)2SO): δ7.64 (d, 1H), 7.23 (d, 1H), 4.62–4.65 (t, 2H), 3.32–3.35 (t, 2H)). AOLA and NAS were synthesized as previously reported [41,42,51]. The reaction was conducted at 60 °C overnight. After the solvent was evaporated, the product was purified 3 times by dissolving in tetrahydrofuran and precipitating in ethyl ether. The NIEM conjugated polymer was abbreviated as PNHAN/NIx where x represents the ratio of 2-nitroimidazolyl (NI) group. However, these therapeutic approaches are rather invasive, and are not suitable for CLI patients with severe comorbidity or sepsis [5,6]. DPBS was supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) to prevent the growth of bacteria. 2.6.Fabrication and characterization of oxygen-release microspheresThe oxygen-release microspheres were fabricated by coaxial electrospraying. Blends of PNHAN and PNHAN/NI18 with molar ratio of 0, 3/7 and 9/1 were dissolved in DCM at a concentration of 5 wt%. PVP was dissolved in 30% H2O2. The flow rates of the PVP/H2O2 complex and PNHAN solution were 0.2 and 1 mL/h, respectively. The flow rates of the PVP/H2O2 complex and PNHAN solution were 0.2 and 1 mL/h, respectively. The flow rates of the PVP/H2O2 complex and PNHAN solution were 0.2 and 1 mL/h, respectively.
