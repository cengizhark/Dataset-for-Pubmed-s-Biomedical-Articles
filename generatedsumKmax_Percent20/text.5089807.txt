The cardiomyocyte data support our findings in neurons that telomere shortening can trigger age-related marker expression in cells with no or minimal capacity for cell proliferation.In addition to the aging phenotypes observed, neurons with shortened telomeres also show preliminary evidence for disease specific phenotypes. Taking one additional step forward, we have recently presented a strategy to genetically trigger age-like features in iPSC derivatives towards modeling of a late onset disease by engineering the overexpression of progerin in iPSC-derived mDA neurons (Miller et al , 2013). In the present study we show that telomerase is downregulated and telomeres get shorter during neuronal differentiation and that the telomeres of hPSC and hPSC derivatives can be further shortened using a pharmacological approach. Importantly, as shown in (Vera et al , 2012) the rate of increase in the percentage of short telomeres over time (slope), and not the absolute telomere length, is a significant predictor of lifespan in mice. Our current study represents a proof of concept for the use of telomere shortening as an “induced aging” strategy suitable for iPSC-based disease modeling. Telomere length values were analyzed using individual telomere spots (>1800 per sample) and fluorescence intensities were converted into kilobases as described previously (Canela et al , 2007; McIlrath et al , 2001). were then multiplied by the dilution factor and normalized by the Day 0 (Fig. However, after birth, telomerase is repressed in most somatic tissue (Blasco et al , 1995), and as a consequence, progressive telomere erosion occurs in most somatic cells throughout life. The media is replaced the next day with RPMI supplemented with B27 and BMP4 (10nM). Flow Cytometry, mtROS and Cycle AnalysesCells were dissociated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) and stained with directly conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences). The primers used are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures section. ImmunostainingCells were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 30 minutes. ImmunostainingCells were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 30 minutes. Cells were stained with primary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA at 4°C overnight, washed and stained with secondary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature, in the dark. The following primary antibodies were used: TH (1:1000; Pel Freeze), FOXA2 (Santa Cruz; 1:200), OCT4 (1:100; Santa Cruz), NANOG (1:50; R&D), and phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139; clone 20E3; 1:400; Cell Signaling). Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) AnalysisCells were harvested by trypsin treatment, washed with PBS, pelleted and frozen at −80°C for genomic DNA collection. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 40mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 40mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C. Interestingly, these pathologies present in human patients have been modeled in mice only when studied in combination with telomerase deficiency and short telomeres in the context of the telomerase-deficient mouse model (Blasco, 2005). In the other hand, treatment of old mice with adeno associated virus (AAV) expressing mouse TERT delays physiological aging and extends longevity by improving health and fitness (Bernardes de Jesus et al , 2012). Finally, individuals with short telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) appear to be more prone to neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD and dementia (Grodstein et al , 2008; Guan et al , 2012; Hochstrasser et al , 2012; Honig et al , 2012; Honig et al , 2006; Jenkins et al , 2006; Kume et al , 2012; Maeda et al , 2012; Martin-Ruiz et al , 2006; Panossian et al , 2003; Thomas et al , 2008; von Zglinicki et al , 2000; Watfa et al , 2011). Telomere dynamics in neural differentiationAs a first step toward generating neural cells with reduced telomere length by telomerase downregulation we set out to define the best time point for downregulating telomerase. Therefore we measured telomere length and the dynamics of telomerase activity during neuronal differentiation in vitro. Based on these results, we used 10μM and 40μM concentration of BIBR1532 for treating hPSCs with DMSO as a control. In the PARKIN line, the 10μM treatment group only increased the percentage of short telomeres, while no decrease in the mean telomere length was observed at this concentration (Fig. We showed that PROGERIN expression induces both general aging-associated phenotypes such as abnormal nuclear morphologies and accumulation of DNA damage and ROS as well as features more specific to neuronal aging such as shorter dendrites. Those data are compatible with the notion that the percentage of short telomeres is a more sensitive parameter than the mean telomere length in individual cells (Hemann et al , 2001; Vera et al , 2012; Vera and Blasco, 2012).
