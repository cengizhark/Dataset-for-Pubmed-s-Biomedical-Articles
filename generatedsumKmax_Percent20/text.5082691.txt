Information on ER, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and tumor characteristics were abstracted from pathology reports.A single control was matched to each case on factors at blood collection; age (within 1 year), month (+/− 1 month) and time of day (+/− 2 hours) of blood collection, fasting status (>=10 hours since last meal vs. <10 hours or unknown), and menopausal status and menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use (premenopausal, postmenopausal/no HT use, postmenopausal/HT use, unknown menopausal status). FlOP_360 characterizes the interaction between lipid oxidation productions and protein, DNA and carbohydrates [24]. Thus, we adjusted for this batch variation using methods described by Rosner et al [31] as we have used previously [32]. All statistical tests were two-sided and p values were considered statistically significant at <0.05; analyses were conducted in SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two-sided and p values were considered statistically significant at <0.05; analyses were conducted in SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Cases and controls were similar with regard to BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, age at menarche, age at first birth and plasma FlOP concentrations, although cases were more likely than controls to report a family history of breast cancer and a prior diagnosis of benign breast disease, and were less physically active (Table 1). For FIOP_360 and FIOP_400, results did appear to differ according to BMI at blood collection although the interactions were not statistically significant (pint=0.23 and pint=0.37 respectively). While this study is the first to focus primarily on the role of plasma FlOP and ER− breast cancer, our null findings are generally consistent with prior prospective studies of both urinary [13,14] and plasma [16,17] markers of oxidative stress and overall breast cancer risk. A reduced risk of overall breast cancer in relation to a urinary marker of lipid peroxidation was also observed among lean women in a prior prospective study of Chinese women [13]; however, in our prior smaller study, we observed a positive association of FlOP_320 and overall breast cancer risk among lean women and no heterogeneity in associations of FlOP_360 and FlOP_400 by BMI [16]. Strengths of this study include the relatively large sample size of ER− breast cancer cases with measured carotenoid levels, and use of comprehensive plasma measures of oxidative stress. However, given our lack of findings with breast cancer, other specific markers of oxidative stress may be more important in breast cancer etiology, although urinary markers of lipid peroxidation also were not associated with breast cancer risk in the prospective Shanghai Women’s Health Study [13,14]. It is also possible that different time periods of exposure may have differing effects for carcinogenesis. Given the consistent findings of inverse associations of carotenoids and ER-breast cancer, oxidative stress pathways should continue to be investigated as a potential etiologic mechanism for this aggressive breast cancer subtype.
