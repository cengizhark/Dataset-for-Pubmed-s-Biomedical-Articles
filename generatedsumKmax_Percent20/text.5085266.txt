2), a region located approximately 457–293 kb from SSR 20338 in the direction away from CsPPR336. The MSC mutants of cucumber are useful research tools for mitochondrial genetics (Lilly et al  2001; Bartoszewski et al  2004, 2007; Del Valle-Echevarria et al  2015). These MSC mutants possess misshapen cotyledons and chlorotic leaves, and show lower seed germination, slower growth, and poor fertility relative to wild-type plants (Malepszy et al  1996). We focused on Csa3M824840.1 as a likely candidate for Psm because it is a PPR-containing gene annotated as PPR336 in Arabidopsis (At1G61870). Although transformation of cucumber remains challenging, proof that CsPPR336 is indeed the Psm locus will require transformation of the Psm+ allele into a Psm −/− plant, followed by crossing of transformed plants with MSC16 as the male and scoring of progenies as MSC versus wild-type. The unique transmission modes of the cucumber organelles [maternal for chloroplast and paternal for mitochondria (Havey 1997)] allow for the separation of organellar effects by reciprocal crossing. Subsequent sequencing of the mtDNA of MSC16 revealed that 258 kb was either missing or significantly under-represented relative to the mtDNA of wild-type B (Del Valle-Echevarria et al  2015). Subsequent sequencing of the mtDNA of MSC16 revealed that 258 kb was either missing or significantly under-represented relative to the mtDNA of wild-type B (Del Valle-Echevarria et al  2015). Subsequent sequencing of the mtDNA of MSC16 revealed that 258 kb was either missing or significantly under-represented relative to the mtDNA of wild-type B (Del Valle-Echevarria et al  2015). Havey et al  (2004) made crosses with MSC16 as the male parent to diverse plant introductions (PI) of cucumber and occasionally observed a high proportion of wild-type progenies. A total of 45 SNPs and 340 F2 individuals were selected after eliminating individuals with fewer than 25 (out of 45) SNPs scored, as well as markers that were genotyped on fewer than 100 (out of 349) individuals. After filtering, a total of 40 markers (Supplemental File 2) were used to construct the genetic map using the ripple command with a four-marker window, following the likelihood method (error probability = 0.005). After filtering, a total of 40 markers (Supplemental File 2) were used to construct the genetic map using the ripple command with a four-marker window, following the likelihood method (error probability = 0.005). After filtering, a total of 40 markers (Supplemental File 2) were used to construct the genetic map using the ripple command with a four-marker window, following the likelihood method (error probability = 0.005). After filtering, a total of 40 markers (Supplemental File 2) were used to construct the genetic map using the ripple command with a four-marker window, following the likelihood method (error probability = 0.005). Plants in the family Cucurbitaceae have a wide range of mtDNA sizes (Ward et al  1981), for example watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) at 379 kilobases (kb) and melon (Cucumis melo L.) at approximately 2740 kb (Alverson et al  2010; Rodriguez-Moreno et al  2011). Alverson et al  (2011) sequenced and assembled the 1685 kb mtDNA of the cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivar ‘Calypso’ and showed that it primarily exists as three chromosomes of approximately 1556, 84, and 45 kb. A major QTL at position 119 cM (LOD = 40) and a minor QTL at position 131 cM (LOD = 3.1) were above the threshold LOD of 2.6 (Fig. Pockets of repetitive DNAs present in the cucumber mtDNA allow for recombination to produce different conformations even among individual plants of the same cultivar or population (Lilly and Havey 2001; Lilly et al  2001; Alverson et al  2011). An ANOVA performed on the major QTL was significantly (p < 0.0001) associated with percentage of wild-type progeny, explaining 69 % of the variance. Six genes in this region were annotated to have organellar functions, two mitochondrial (Csa3M824840.1 and Csa3M824970.2) and four chloroplast (Csa3M824870.1, Csa3M825000.1, Csa3M825040.1 and Csa5M146950.1) (Supplemental File 3). We disregarded chloroplast-targeted genes because Psm is associated with paternally transmitted mitochondria. Segregation analysis of restriction-site polymorphism in CsPPR336The S220R polymorphism in CsPPR336 results in the loss of a BsaWI restriction site in P3A (Fig. We determined segregations for this BsaWI polymorphism and the phenotypes (MSC versus wild-type) of progenies. We then crossed three wild-type hybrid progenies as the female with three of the relatively rare MSC progenies as the male (all plants should be heterozygous at Psm), and progenies from this cross produced the expected 1:1 ratio of wild-type versus MSC progeny (p = 0.880). For 96 randomly selected wild-type progenies, the presence versus absence of the BsaWI site segregated 54:42, fitting the expected 1:1 ratio (p = 0.221).
