Further evidence of PFC noradrenergic modulation of attentional processing comes from the study of working memory (Arnsten et al  1988; Franowicz and Arnsten 1999, for a review, see Arnsten 2004). Effects of systemic guanfacine administrationGuanfacine dose-dependently decreased discriminative accuracy and increased correct latency in NA-depleted animals only [lesion × dose interaction F(2.76,17)=4.24, p=0.012 for accuracy, and F(2.44,17)=7.82, p=0.001 for correct latency, respectively, see Fig. Although NA-depleted animals were significantly quicker to respond correctly than shams under saline control conditions (p=0.035), at the three highest dose levels they were slower to respond both as compared to their own saline control performance (p<0.01 for 0.1,0.3,and 1 mg/kg) and sham-operated control animals at the same dose (p=0.031, p=0.025, p<0.001; p=0.003 for 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg guanfacine, respectively). This investigation evaluated the effects of regionally selective NA depletion in the rat PFC via anti-DβH–saporin immunolesioning on visual attentional performance. Indeed, this was unlikely because (1) anti-DβH–saporin is specifically taken up and transported retrogradely to LC noradrenergic neurons (Stirpe and Barbieri 1986;Wrenn et al  1996); (2) intracerebroventricular anti-DβH–saporin is not reported to affect tyrosine–hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons (Wrenn et al  1996). Such compounds also protect against the deleterious effects of white noise distraction on performance (Arnsten and Contant 1992). Thus, deficits in the latency to respond correctly to the visual target stimuli emerged when their presentation was made temporally unpredictable. Thus, deficits in the latency to respond correctly to the visual target stimuli emerged when their presentation was made temporally unpredictable. The pattern of results is also consistent, in a general sense, with the hypothesis that phasic activity in the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system mediates “focused” attention as removal of the presynaptic noradrenergic terminals by anti-DβH–saporin would impair such phasic activity (Aston-Jones et al  1999). These effects contrast with the beneficial effects reported for working memory in rats and monkeys that have been suggested to depend on actions at postsynaptic adrenoceptors (e.g., Arnsten 2004).There are at least two plausible hypotheses for the guanfacine-induced attentional impairment. These beneficial effects of α-2 adreno-receptor stimulation may be mediated primarily via post-synaptic receptors located in the PFC, which may also become supersensitive as a consequence of selective NA depletion in this region (see Arnsten 2004). These beneficial effects of α-2 adreno-receptor stimulation may be mediated primarily via post-synaptic receptors located in the PFC, which may also become supersensitive as a consequence of selective NA depletion in this region (see Arnsten 2004). This effect to reduce impulsivity may be relevant to the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by such drugs as clonidine and guanfacine, where there is a need to treat impulsive behavior and to remediate attentional deficits.Although there have been some studies, including from our own laboratory, of some beneficial effects of α-2A receptor agonist on cognition in humans (Coull et al  1995, 1997, 2004; Jakala et al  1999), deficits also arise. However, it is possible in certain situations resulting in impaired performance (due to stress or psychopathology) that guanfacine may confer benefits via a behavioral “calming” effect that does indeed depend on baseline state. One to two rats were housed per cage in a reverse light cycle room (lights on 7:00 a.m.). Bilateral microinfusions of vehicle (PBS, pH 7.4) or DβH–saporin (0.02 μg/infusion, 0.5 μl infusion volume) were carried out using 31-gauge, non-beveled stainless steel injectors (Cooper Needle Works, UK) at a rate of 0.17 μl/min commencing 1 min after lowering the injectors in the brain. Animals were given a week to recover from surgery before being retested. ApparatusRats were tested in nine-hole boxes as described in Carli et al  (1983). Five of the nine apertures were used during the course of the study, and four holes (the second, fourth, sixth, and eight holes) were occluded with metal plates. Five of the nine apertures were used during the course of the study, and four holes (the second, fourth, sixth, and eight holes) were occluded with metal plates. A food magazine was situated on the wall opposite the nose-poke apertures. Each session consisted of 100 trials and lasted approximately 30 min. Perseverative responding, defined as repeated responding in any hole during the presentation of the light stimulus or during the limited hold period, was monitored but not punished. Each session was broken down into 10-min time bins. The first high event rate challenge (27–30 days post-surgery) consisted of reducing the fixed intertrial interval to 2 s. The second challenge (36–37 days post-op) employed a short variable ITI schedule in which (instead of the usual fixed 5 s intertrial interval) the ITI varied randomly between 0.5 and 4.5 s (ITI values of 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 s). Histological proceduresAt the conclusion of the behavioral testing, the animals were given a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg ml−1 kg−1, i.p., Euthatal, Vet Drug, Bury St. Edmunds, UK) and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. From the anterior prefrontal cortex to the fimbria fornix (+5.20 to −0.40 mm from bregma) then further at the level of the locus coeruleus (−9.16 to −10.80 mm, every fourth section (40 μm) was collected in PBS. Sections were then rinsed in PBS (3×5 min) followed by a 10-min wash in phosphate nonsaline buffer, mounted onto subbed slides and air-dried overnight. Aliquots of tissue were removed from four consecutive sections using a micropunch of diameter 0.75 mm. Aliquots of tissue were removed from four consecutive sections using a micropunch of diameter 0.75 mm. StatisticsSPSS 13 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.All effects were examined using mixed-model ANOVA with a number of different within-subject factors but a constant between subject factor of Lesion (presence or absence of NA depletion). Subcortical structures were spared at all levels (see Table 1). Additionally, visualization of the floor of the fourth ventricle revealed a loss of DβH-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus of lesioned animals compared to shams. This was especially true during the intermediate time blocks [F(5,19)=2.53, p=0.034 for the time block/bin × lesion interaction; pair-wise comparison, p=0.015, p=0.029, and p=0.010, for blocks 2–4, respectively].High event rate: variable ITIAs shown in Fig.
