Through LC MS/MS protein identification, we obtained several peptide-matching propositions including the ALHELGVYYLPDAEGAFR peptide (fig. S5B) already reported in public databases (www.proteomicsdb.org/), and we identified a cryptic peptide VPFQFGLPGPPGPPGPQGPP GPIIPPEALLK corresponding to the VPFQ insertion at position 108 of ERFE (Fig. For this purpose, recombinant proteins ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ were produced in HEK293F cells. S6C), resulting from both a lower concentration of hepcidin and a higher concentration of ferritin in SF3B1MUT patients. How these aberrant splicing events contribute to the disease phenotype and in particular to systemic iron overload is unclear. S6F).To validate these findings, we prospectively enrolled an external cohort of lower risk MDS patients in our study until the proportion of patients with SF3B1MUT MDS was comparable to that in the training cohort (table S5). S6F).To validate these findings, we prospectively enrolled an external cohort of lower risk MDS patients in our study until the proportion of patients with SF3B1MUT MDS was comparable to that in the training cohort (table S5). To assess the influence of RBC transfusion in our analysis, we delineated a subset of 61 patients with MDS in the training cohort, including 25 SF3B1MUT and 36 SF3B1WT patients with a low transfusion burden before inclusion (<4 RBC units per 8 weeks). S7C, S7D), and the circulating ERFE concentration remained significantly increased in low transfusion burden SF3B1MUT patients compared to SF3B1WT patients (P<0.0001; fig. We then explored the determinants of hyperferritinemia >300 μg/ml in low transfusion burden patients. By multivariate analysis, ERFE, hepcidin, and SF3B1 mutation remained independent predictors of high ferritin concentration (Table 1). Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and twisted gastrulation (TWSG1), two members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, have been proposed as pathological suppressors of hepcidin in ineffective erythropoiesis (26, 27). The expression of ERFE+12 was restricted to the erythroid lineage, increased with the differentiation of SF3B1MUT erythroblasts, and was higher in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT erythroblasts (Fig. We have previously shown that lenalidomide administered to ESA-resistant non-del(5q) MDS patients targets the malignant clone and in some cases, eliminates the dominant SF3B1MUT clone for the duration of response (34). We have previously shown that lenalidomide administered to ESA-resistant non-del(5q) MDS patients targets the malignant clone and in some cases, eliminates the dominant SF3B1MUT clone for the duration of response (34). We have previously shown that lenalidomide administered to ESA-resistant non-del(5q) MDS patients targets the malignant clone and in some cases, eliminates the dominant SF3B1MUT clone for the duration of response (34). By contrast, in GFM-LenEpo-2008, the ratio ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT decreased in 6 responding patients but remained stable in 8 non-responding patients (Fig. This confirms that lenalidomide may target clonal erythropoiesis. Our results suggest that ERFE+12 expression may correlate with OS for SF3B1MUT MDS patients. In the spliceosome, SF3b complex interacts with the pre-mRNA and is involved in the branch site selection during splicing. Mutations in SF3B1 affect the structure of SF3b RNA-binding platform, resulting in the selection of alternative branch site and alternative transcripts, of which more than 50% are subjected to NMD (11, 13, 37). Among alternative in-frame junctions, we identified two regulators of iron homeostasis, ABCB7 and ERFE. Other candidate regulators of hepcidin linked to erythropoiesis have been proposed, including EPO and GDF-15. Although EPO administration decreases hepcidin concentration (43), this effect is predominantly indirect. The other candidate, GDF-15, is poorly induced by EPO in human volunteers. In patients with low transfusion burden, who had received a mean of 0.5 RBC unit, hepcidin, ERFE and SF3B1 mutation were independent predictors of hyperferritinemia. In patients with low transfusion burden, who had received a mean of 0.5 RBC unit, hepcidin, ERFE and SF3B1 mutation were independent predictors of hyperferritinemia. Further clinical studies will be required to validate ERFE+12 expression as a therapy-responsive biomarker of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with SF3B1MUT MDS. Further clinical studies will be required to validate ERFE+12 expression as a therapy-responsive biomarker of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with SF3B1MUT MDS. The prospective cohort of 90 MDS patients with survival data was enrolled between 2010 and 2018. The prospective cohort of 90 MDS patients with survival data was enrolled between 2010 and 2018. The prospective cohort of 90 MDS patients with survival data was enrolled between 2010 and 2018. For the validation cohort, MDS patients (n=55) were enrolled prospectively for plasma collection in France (5 centers; IRB Onco-CCH 2015-08-11DC) and Germany (one center; IRB Ethikkommission an der TU Dresden; EK 115032015) between 2016 and 2018. For the validation cohort, MDS patients (n=55) were enrolled prospectively for plasma collection in France (5 centers; IRB Onco-CCH 2015-08-11DC) and Germany (one center; IRB Ethikkommission an der TU Dresden; EK 115032015) between 2016 and 2018. BM samples from 5 age-matched controls and PB plasma samples from 20 healthy controls were collected. Patient characteristics are indicated in tables S1, S5, and S7 and according to the response to epoetin ζ in table S6. CRISPR/Cas9 generation of isogenic Sf3b1K700E and Sf3b1WT cell linesThe murine erythroid cell line G1E-ER4 (58) was used to generate isogenic Sf3b1K700E and Sf3b1WT cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9-stimulated homology-mediated repair. Data were analyzed using Mascot 2.5.1 (www.matrixscience.com). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to calculate the thresholds of positivity. After excluding differentially expressed canonical junctions, we then considered the 1,147 alternative junctions, among which we identified 786 3’ acceptor junctions (68.5%), 176 5’ donor junctions (15.3%), and 185 ambiguous junctions (16.1%) attributed to either the alternative 5’ or 3’ss or both alternative 5’ and 3’ss (Fig. The proportion of alternative AG’ junctions in these novel splice variants was generally increased in SF3B1 mutants and less frequently in SF3B1WT samples (Fig. Splicing factor gene SF3B1 is mutated in ~90% of MDS-RS, and the diagnosis is considered whenever the gene is mutated, even if the percentage of RS is relatively low, between 5 and 15% (5–7). These minigenes were transfected into the murine G1E-ER4 cell line in which the SF3B1K700E mutation was edited by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. After transfection, the alternative 3’ss AG’ ERFE+12 was detected by capillary electrophoresis in G1E-ER4 SF3B1K700E cells, but not in the isogenic G1E-ER4 SF3B1WT or parental cells (Fig. The selection of an alternative branch site resulting in the use of a cryptic 3’ splice site (ss) is the most frequently detected abnormality. This supports a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutation and the aberrant splicing isoform of ERFE (fig.

This supports a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutation and the aberrant splicing isoform of ERFE (fig. This further supports the idea that ERFE+12 is related to SF3B1 mutation. The addition of 12 nucleotides in ERFE mRNA generates an ERFE variant (further referred to as ERFEVPFQ) containing a valine-proline-phenylalanine-glutamine (VPFQ) insertion immediately upstream of the collagen domain (Fig.
