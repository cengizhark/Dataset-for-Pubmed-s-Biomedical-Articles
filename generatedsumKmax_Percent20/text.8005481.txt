Unfortunately, most preventive measures among WESW have focused on risk reduction for HIV transmission, ignoring their psychosocial wellbeing and mental health needs (Ampt et al , 2020; Cowan et al , 2018). The additional 4.9% variance in depressive symptoms was statistically significant (p<.05). Consistent with previous studies, sex work stigma was associated with high levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms (Carlson et al , 2017; Stockton et al , 2020; Zehnder et al , 2019). Therefore, integrating economic strengthening components in the programs targeting WESW is critical to address their mental health wellbeing. Scores are not meant to be interpreted as a diagnosis of depression or another mental health disorder –as this requires further assessment. Second, data were self-reported by WESW and may have been influenced by social desirability biases to minimize or hide depressive symptoms. In addition, the high rates of poverty in SSA, including in Uganda, drive women into commercial sex work (Baleta, 2015; fielding-Miller et al , 2014). As such, this is an important area of inquiry, as findings may inform the development and incorporation of mental health services in HIV-related programming targeting WESW – given their particularly high levels of vulnerability in low-resource settings. The research team obtained contact information of key individuals –hereafter site coordinators, at each potential site. All participants who provided consent were then allowed to complete baseline assessments and biomarker testing. 2.3.Ethical ConsiderationsAll study procedures were approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (#201811106), Columbia University Institutional Review Board (AAAR9804), and the in-country local IRBs in Uganda: Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Research Ethics Committee (GC/127/18/10/690) and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST –SS4828). 2.3.Ethical ConsiderationsAll study procedures were approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (#201811106), Columbia University Institutional Review Board (AAAR9804), and the in-country local IRBs in Uganda: Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Research Ethics Committee (GC/127/18/10/690) and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST –SS4828). Informed voluntary written consent was obtained from all study participants prior to participation. Each interviewer received Good Clinical Practice training and obtained the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Human Subjects Certificate before interacting with study participants. The theoretical range for this scale is 7–35, with high summated scores indicating higher levels of family cohesion (Cronbach alpha = 0.85). The theoretical range for this scale is 7–35, with high summated scores indicating higher levels of family cohesion (Cronbach alpha = 0.85). Responses were binary coded with No = 0 and Yes = 1, with high scores indicating high levels of domestic violence attitudes.2.4.3.Economic level FactorsThese were measured by the following indicators: 1) financial distress was measured by five items assessing the ability to access basic needs, including money to buy food, clothing, transportation, housing fees/rent, and health or medical expenses (1 = Never and 4 = Many times); 2) household assets were measured using a 21-item index assessing the availability of assets (e.g., land, a house, means of transportation, gardens, or means of communication). This is worsened by high levels of stigma attached to mental health (Audu, et al , 2013; Kapungwe et al , 2010; Ssebunnya, et al , 2009). first, we conducted descriptive analyses for all the predictors and outcome variables. Second, hierarchical regression models were conducted to determine the predictors of depressive symptoms and PTSD. In model 2, when we controlled for economic-level factors (financial distress, household assets, currently working for pay and number of income earners in the household), HIV status (b= −1.16, 95% CI = −2.21, −0.11, p ≤.05), family cohesion (b= −0.09, 95% CI= −0.16, −0.02, p ≤ .01) and sex work stigma (b=0.14, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.20, p ≤ .001) remained significant predictors of PTSD.
