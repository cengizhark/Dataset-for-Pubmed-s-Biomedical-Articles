The NAC core but not the shell exhibits Fos protein expression, a marker of neuronal activation, concomitant with expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference (Miller and Marshall 2005), whereas both NAC subregions exhibit Fos protein expression associated with instrumental cocaine-seeking behavior in a cocaine-paired context (Neisewander et al  2000; Hamlin et al  2008). However, Fos protein expression in the NAC core is not observed if the act of cocaine seeking is prevented through retraction of the response lever (Neisewander et al  2000). Similarly, separate 2×2 ANOVAs of active lever presses, inactive lever presses, and food pellets obtained during the two food self-administration test sessions failed to indicate NAC subregion or treatment main or interaction effects (F(1,15)=0.002–3.04, p=0.10–0.96). Furthermore, recent pharmacological studies have demonstrated that D1-dopamine receptor stimulation within the NAC shell and glutamate receptor stimulation in the NAC shell or core are necessary for drug context-induced heroin-seeking behavior (Bossert et al  2006; Bossert et al  2007). Reinstatement likely reflected context-induced motivation for cocaine as opposed to dishabituation produced by a context shift, since exposure to a novel context fails to elicit an increase in lever responding in this animal model (Fuchs et al  2005). In fact, effect sizes appeared to be greater in the NAC shell (79% inhibition) than in the NAC core (57% inhibition), which is consistent with previous studies that revealed a selective role for dopamine D1 receptor stimulation in the NAC shell but a role for glutamate neurotransmission in both the NAC shell and core in context-induced renewal of heroin-seeking behavior (Bossert et al  2006, 2007). According to one such study, 20 ng muscimol delivered in a larger (1 μl) infusion volume than that used in the present study impairs electrophysiological activity directly and indirectly, via the inhibition of postsynaptic neurons, in a 1-mm radius (Arikan et al  2002). More importantly, using the same B/M dose and microinfusion parameters, we and others have demonstrated functional differentiation between the NAC core and shell in CS-induced and cocaine-primed cocaine-seeking behavior, with effects observed in the NAC core only (McFarland and Kalivas 2001; Fuchs et al  2004). Also, fundamental similarities exist between the anatomical connectivity of the NAC shell and olfactory tubercle, which suggests that the NAC shell–olfactory tubercle complex may comprise a functional unit with respect to context-induced goal-directed behavior (Sesack et al  1989; Bossert et al  2007; Ikemoto 2007). Furthermore, dopamine D1 receptor antagonism in the NAC shell or group 2 metabotropic glutamate autoreceptor stimulation in the NAC shell or core impairs reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior in a heroin-paired context without altering responding in the extinction context (Bossert et al  2006, 2007). Perhaps, most relevant to the present study, tetrodotoxin-induced or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist-induced neural inactivation of the NAC disrupts discriminative stimulus control over food-seeking behavior by increasing the latency to respond to a food-predictive discriminative stimulus and increasing responding in the absence of cues and on the inactive lever (Yun et al  2004). In a previous study, GABA agonist-induced neural inactivation of the NAC shell failed to inhibit CS-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior (Fuchs et al  2004). The apparent discrepancy between this and the present findings may be related to the maintenance of CS-induced and context-induced reinstatement by conditioned reinforcers and occasion setters, respectively. Other sources of efferent input to the NAC shell may include elements of the shared context/CS and context/CS/drug reinstatement circuitries, such as the BLA, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and ventral hippocampus (Sesack et al  1989; McDonald 1991; McDonald 1991; McLaughlin and See 2003; Fuchs et al  2005; Fuchs et al  2007; Rogers and See 2007; Peters et al  2008; Fuchs, unpublished data). Furthermore, dopamine neurons in the VTA innervate almost all elements of the known reinstatement circuitry and influence its activity, since dopamine receptor blockade systemically or selectively in the NAC shell disrupts context-induced renewal of cocaine- and heroin-seeking behavior, respectively (Crombag et al  2002; Bossert et al  2007). These brain regions include the BLA, dmPFC, dorsolateral caudate-putamen (dlCPu), and the reciprocally connected VTA (Heimer et al  1991; McDonald 1991; Crombag et al  2002; Heidbreder and Groenewegen 2003; McLaughlin and See 2003; Fuchs et al  2005; Fuchs et al  2007). While the present study did not reveal NAC subregion-specific effects on context-induced reinstatement, it is probable that distinct neuronal subcircuits and neurochemical mechanisms within the NAC core and shell, as well as the larger reinstatement circuitry, mediate context-induced versus other forms of cocaine-seeking behavior, and these subcircuits may be differentially susceptible to cocaine-induced and experience-based neuroadaptations (Neisewander et al  2004; Bossert et al  2006; Fuchs et al  2006; See et al  2007). Rats were maintained on 20–25 g of rat chow per day, with water available ad libitum. Rats were maintained on 20–25 g of rat chow per day, with water available ad libitum. In cocaine users, craving and resumption of drug use can be precipitated by exposure to drug-associated cues, stress, or drug itself (Jaffe et al  1989; Childress et al  1993; O'Brien et al  1998; Sinha 2001). SurgeryForty-eight hours after food training, rats were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine (66.6 and 1.3 g/kg, respectively, intraperitoneal). Chronic indwelling catheters were constructed using a bent-steel cannula with a screw-type connector (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA), SILASTIC tubing (10 m, inner diameter 0.64 m, outer diameter 1.19 m, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA), Prolite monofilament mesh (Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH, USA), and cranioplastic cement, as described previously (Fuchs et al  2007). Context 1 contained a continuous red houselight (0.4 fc brightness) on the wall opposite to the active lever, intermittent pure tone (80 dB, 1 kHz; 2 s on, 2 s off), pine-scented air freshener strip (4.5×2 cm, Car Freshener, Waterton, NY, USA), and wire mesh floor (26×27 cm). Rats had no exposure to these contextual stimuli prior to cocaine self-administration training. The stimuli were presented throughout each session independent of responding, as in our previous studies (Fuchs et al  2005; Fuchs et al  2007). During the adaptation procedure, stainless steel injection cannulae (33 G, Plastics One) were bilaterally inserted into the rat's guide cannulae to a depth of 2 mm below the tip of the guide cannulae. Intracranial MicroinfusionsFor intracranial microinfusions, the injection cannulae were connected to 10-μl Hamilton syringes (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) that were mounted on an infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). In the present study, muscimol was administered at 12 ng/0.3 μl; thus, the area of neural inactivation was significantly smaller due to reduced infusion volume. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist-induced functional inactivation of or glutamate antagonism within the NAC core uniformly inhibits all forms of reinstatement (McFarland and Kalivas 2001; Fuchs et al  2004; McFarland et al  2004; Peters and Kalivas 2006; Bäckström and Hyytiä 2007). Similar information about the spread of baclofen hydrobromide is not available, but its spread is likely limited by low lipophilicity (Leisen et al  2003). Importantly, we and others have used this dose of B/M in the past to demonstrate functional differentiation between the NAC core versus shell in CS-induced and cocaine-primed cocaine-seeking behavior (McFarland and Kalivas 2001; Fuchs et al  2004). Immediately after microinfusion, horizontal locomotor activity was measured in novel Plexiglas chambers (42×20×20 cm high), as described previously (Fuchs et al  2007). NAC shell inactivation fails to alter CS-induced (Fuchs et al  2004) but inhibits stress-induced reinstatement (McFarland et al  2004). Rats were then transcardially perfused using 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Fisher Scientific) and 10% formaldehyde solution (Sigma).
