We have shown that the cell-based HTRF cAMP assay is a suitable technology for assaying ligands that may act on G protein-coupled receptor 119. The Z’factor is a standard statistical parameter used to evaluate the robustness of a high throughput assay (Zhang et al , 1999). We tested DMSO at a variety of concentrations and the results showed that the assay can tolerate DMSO up to 1 %. Recently, the fatty acid ethanolamide OEA has been reported to be a putative endogenous ligand for G protein-coupled receptor 119 (Overton et al , 2006). Based on the data with OEA, PEA, and AEA, it has been proposed that the degree of saturation in fatty acid aryl chain might be important for these fatty-acid ethanolamides to activate G protein-coupled receptor 119 (Chu et al , 2010; Overton et al , 2006). Our results indicate that increasing the number of double bonds reduces the ability of these ligands to activate G protein-coupled receptor 119; with compounds containing 1–2 double bonds have significantly higher efficacy and potency than those compounds containing 3–6 double bonds. Thus, they suggested that there might be a broad permissiveness in the amine-derived moieties (the head groups) of lipid amides for being an agonist for G protein-coupled receptor 119 (Chu et al , 2010). It has been shown that administration of G protein-coupled receptor 119 agonists improves glucose tolerance in rodents (Chu et al , 2007a; Chu et al , 2010; Semple et al , 2008). These data suggest that although there are certain levels of permissiveness, in order to activate G protein-coupled receptor 119, there are also certain structural requirements for the head groups of oleoyl amides. Using novel fatty acid amide ligands and detailed potency and efficacy analyses, we then demonstrated that degree of saturation in acyl chain and charged head groups of fatty acid amides have profound effects on the ability of fatty acid amides to activate G protein-coupled receptor 119. A number of cannabinoid ligands and fatty-acid amides have been tested as potential agonists for G protein-coupled receptor 119 (Chu et al , 2010; Overton et al , 2006). For example, Overton and coworkers identified oleoyl ethanolamide (OEA) as an endogenous G protein-coupled receptor 119 ligand (Overton et al , 2006). 384-well, round bottom, low volume white plates were purchased from Grenier Bio One (Monroe, NC). AR231453, Ro 20-1724 and palmitoyl ethanolamide were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Cell Transfection and CultureHuman Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Stably transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 800 µg/ml geneticin and maintained in growth medium containing 400 µg/ml of geneticin (G418) until needed for experiments. Data AnalysisData analyses were performed based on the ratio of fluorescence intensity of each well at 620 nm and 665 nm. For positive controls, the HEK293 cells stably expressing G protein-coupled receptor 119 were treated with the potent G protein-coupled receptor 119 agonist AR231453 at a concentration of 10 µM for 30 min at room temperature. The Z’ value was calculated using the formula: Z’ = 1–3[(standard deviation of negative control) + standard deviation of positive control)]/ [(mean of negative control) − (mean of positive control)] (Zhang et al , 1999). 1B, the cell-based HTRF cAMP assay for G protein-coupled receptor 119 can tolerate DMSO up to 1% without any loss of signal. 1C and Table 1, all three previously reported G protein-coupled receptor 119 ligands, AR231453 (Semple et al , 2008), OEA (Overton et al , 2006), and PSN632408 (Overton et al , 2006), increased the cellular cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner, with a rank order of potency of AR231453 > OEA = PSN632408, and a rank order of efficacy of AR231453 = OEA > PSN632408. G protein-coupled receptor 119 is coupled to Gs, so upon its activation, there is an enhancement of cAMP levels within the cell (Chu et al , 2007b). 3 and Table 3 demonstrate the agonist activity of different oleoyl amides as compared to OEA.
