Acute aortic dissection is relatively uncommon condition and could represent a challenge due to its varying initial clinical presentations with symptoms and signs that overlap with other entities, while at the same time it is crucial to make a prompt diagnose and management [2]. Abrupt onset chest pain is the most common presenting symptoms and mostly describes as sharp, tearing, ripping and excruciating with the maximum severity at the time of onset [1]. In this case patientsâ€™ initial symptom was dyspnea started twelve hours prior to presentation, so a physician must always suspect aortic dissection because atypical presentations can be the case, and also aortic dissection could be accompanied by ACS. In this case, we provided intravascular nitroglycerin to lowers preload and therefore reduces wall stress, resulting in a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand, decreased chest pain and blood pressure. However, an ECG must be performed on all patients with chest pain for the differential diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction of aortic dissection, and to diagnose possible combined aortic dissection and myocardial infarction [1,15]. The clinical key is that always be aware of aortic dissection even though the patient presents only with chest pain that might be similar to chest pain of ACS. 45-year-old obese man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellites and coronary artery disease presented to the emergency department with complain of shortness of breath started about 12 hours before presentation.
