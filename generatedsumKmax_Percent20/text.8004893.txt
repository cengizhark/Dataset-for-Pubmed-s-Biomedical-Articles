Utilization is here operationalized as the percent of possible network-network edges included in the full set of features that were selected on every iteration. In comparison to that of gF and WM, the relationship between predicted attention and WM performance was significantly less strong (Steiger’s Z = 3.36, P = 7.9*10−4): attention network predictions correlated more weakly with observed scores of 2-back accuracy (Figure 3; Table 1, analyses 18 & 20; Supplementary Table S3), as did predicted 2-back accuracy and observed SCPT d’ scores (Table 1, analyses 4 & 9; Supplementary Table S3). Working memory models and fluid intelligence models predict memory score in an external (SMC) datasetTo directly compare the predictive power of WM and gF models, we also applied our gF CPMs to the external SMC dataset including memory-impaired individuals. Several possibilities include differences in participant setting during behavioral testing (in scanner or out of scanner), differences in reliability among behavioral tests used, and differences in the distribution of behavior or age ranges of HCP and SMC subjects, as individual differences in memory are thought to be magnified in aging (Nagel et al , 2008). To do so, we first followed the procedures of Finn et al , 2015 to group our 268 nodes into ten anatomically defined brain regions and eight functionally defined canonical networks. In general, WM networks utilized a wider range of connections throughout the brain, including subcortical and cerebellar regions, while gF networks utilized connections primarily between prefrontal and parietal regions. This overlap was determined to be significant (P = 1.4*10−232) using the hypergeometric cumulative distribution function (Rosenberg et al , 2018). In the present study, we provide a novel demonstration that distributed patterns of functional connectivity are a broadly applicable predictor of individual differences in WM. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have characterized the neural representations underlying models of WM, with multivariate pattern analysis techniques showing that WM representations are sustained in regions including prefrontal, parietal, and sensory cortices (Christophel, Hebart, & Haynes, 2012; Han et al , 2013; Sreenivasan, Vytlacil, & D’Esposito, 2014). The present results align with previous demonstrations of the strong link between WM and gF: gF models strongly predicted WM score in novel individuals, and vice versa. This supports the notion that WM and gF rely on shared neural systems, particularly those involving parietal and prefrontal regions, which allow us to keep a representation active in the face of interference (Engle et al , 1999; Prabhakaran et al , 1997). This suggests that predictive network models of WM do not rely on functional connections that support gF. The fact that that our models of WM capacity and attention lack cross applicability and do not predominantly utilize the same functional connections aligns with recent propositions that WM precision, rather than WM capacity, is what is most influenced by attentional processes and information flow between attentional and perceptual neural systems (Galeano Weber et al , 2017). More generally, work has emphasized the importance of functional connections between distributed brain regions including frontal, parietal, premotor, and occipitotemporal regions in mediating WM (Gazzaley, Rissman, & D’Esposito, 2004; Fiebach, Rissman, & D’Esposito, 2006; Liebe et al , 2012; Liu et al , 2018; Yamashita et al , 2018), with recent work implicating large-scale, distributed networks in WM capacity (Miller & Buschman, 2015; Soreq, Leech, & Hampshire, 2019; Luck & Vogel, 2013; Cohen & D’Esposito, 2016). This approach complements a growing body of work predicting outcomes and behavior from large-scale functional connectivity patterns (e.g., Smith et al , 2015; Gong et al , 2019; see Woo et al , 2017 and Dubois & Adolphs 2016 for recent reviews). Scan parameter details can be found in Ugurbil et al  (2013). Mean frame-to-frame motion for each condition (e.g., n-back task) was calculated by averaging the mean motion for corresponding left/right and right/left phase-encoding runs. Full details of task and rest scan procedures can be found in Barch et al  (2013) and Smith et al  (2013), respectively. Although attention is also required for n-back and PMAT task completion, as it is for nearly every task in daily life (Rosenberg et al , 2016a), we utilized 2-back accuracy, PMAT score, and SCPT d’ as commonly used indications of a participant’s WM, gF, or attentional ability, respectively. Between March 2008 and February 2009, fMRI data and neuropsychological assessments (Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery) were collected from 278 individuals classified into three levels of memory function: Alzheimer’s disease patients (AD; n=112), amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI; n=87), and healthy controls (n=79). Full information regarding patients’ medical histories and diagnostic criteria as well as neuropsychological assessment and fMRI scan procedures are detailed in Ahn et al  (2010) and Kim et al  (2015). Of the 278 patients, aged 44-90 years, we identified the 157 (mean age 68.7 ± 9.6 years; 105 females; 55 AD, 54 aMCI, 48 healthy) who completed all neuropsychological assessments and fMRI runs with average frame-to-frame motion <0.2mm, maximum translation <2mm, and maximum rotational motion <3°. Of the 278 patients, aged 44-90 years, we identified the 157 (mean age 68.7 ± 9.6 years; 105 females; 55 AD, 54 aMCI, 48 healthy) who completed all neuropsychological assessments and fMRI runs with average frame-to-frame motion <0.2mm, maximum translation <2mm, and maximum rotational motion <3°. Nuisance covariates included 24 motion-related parameters (6 translational and rotational motions, 6 derivatives of these motions, and 12 squares of these motions), 3 mean signals (global, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), and linear and quadratic trends. Functional connectivity matrices were created by calculating the Pearson correlation between each of 268 nodes of the whole brain (Shen et al , 2013 whole-brain gray matter atlas). This strong relationship is thought to reflect shared neural systems, particularly involving prefrontal and parietal regions, which allow us to keep a representation active in the face of interference (Engle et al , 1999; Prabhakaran et al , 1997). The predictions of gF and sustained attention CPMs from both task and resting-state data were correlated with observed 2-back accuracy values to assess their ability to predict WM task performance.Cross-predictive power was expected and indeed observed between WM and gF models. External validation in an independent, older age sample with memory impairmentTo test whether WM CPMs defined in the HCP dataset were robust to participant population, scan site and parameters, and memory measure, we applied them to resting-state functional connectivity matrices from the SMC sample. Verbal memory was quantified by verbal recall performance on the Seoul Verbal Learning Task, during which subjects verbally recalled items from a list of 12 words before and after a 20-minute delay (Ahn et al , 2010).
