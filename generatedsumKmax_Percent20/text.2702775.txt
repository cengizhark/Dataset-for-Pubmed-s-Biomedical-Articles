PAK1 can be activated by Rac and Cdc42 proteins, yet the morphology of PAK1−/− macrophages is similar to Wt macrophages and does not resemble that of macrophages lacking Rac1 and Rac2 (Wheeler et al , 2006), which have elongated narrow protrusions. Loss of Rac proteins, therefore, has a stronger morphological phenotype than loss of PAK1. PAK1 affects both the actin cytoskeleton (Edwards et al , 1999; Sanders et al , 1999) and the microtubule network (Daub et al , 2001; Wittmann et al , 2004), and is thereby implicated in cell migration (Adam et al , 1998; Ching et al , 2007; Sells et al , 1999; Zhou et al , 2003), phagocytosis (Dharmawardhane et al , 1999; Diakonova et al , 2002) and cell spreading in platelets (Suzuki-Inoue et al , 2001) and fibroblasts (ten Klooster et al , 2006). The most widely reported mechanism for PAK1-mediated activation of ERK1/2 is via direct phosphorylation of the MAPK kinase MEK1 by PAK1 on S298 (Beeser et al , 2005; Frost et al , 1997; Park et al , 2007), however, no changes in MEK1 S298 phosphorylation levels or MEK1/2 activity were observed in PAK1−/− BMMs, suggesting that there is an alternative mechanism for regulation of ERK1/2 by PAK1. A function for ERK1/2 during adhesion has previously been observed in epithelial cells, and ERK1/2 can phosphorylate the adhesion adaptor protein paxillin, providing a binding site for FAK (Ishibe et al , 2004). PAK1 could also affect cell shape via regulation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were derived as previously described (Wells et al , 2004). Transfected BMMs were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours in growth medium before use in experiments. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr at room temperature. They were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised in 0.5% Triton X-100 and then blocked with 20% goat serum for 30 minutes at room temperature. Although the MAPKs are typically associated with regulation of transcription, they also affect cell migration and adhesion. After 24 hours, transmigrated cells were fixed and stained using the REASTAIN Quick-Diff kit (Reagena). An image frame was collected every 10 minutes for 8 hours using Kinetic Imaging Motion Analysis software (Andor Technology). ERK1/2 can localise to the plasma membrane (Glading et al , 2001; Harding et al , 2005), in endosomes (Kermorgant et al , 2004) and to focal adhesions (Fincham et al , 2000), and is activated upon adhesion in a PAK-dependent manner (Eblen et al , 2002; Sundberg-Smith et al , 2005). From these movies, the number of lamellipodia was quantitated at different timepoints, and the perimeter length of individual lamellipodia was measured using Metamorph 5.01 (Universal Imaging Systems). Lamellipodial extension dynamics were analysed on kymographs generated from the time-lapse movies (Metamorph 5.0.1). ERK1/2 has also been reported to phosphorylate paxillin, promoting lamellipodium formation and spreading in a FAK- and Rac-dependent manner (Ishibe et al , 2004). Extracellular matrix composition affects cell shape by activating integrins, inducing intracellular signalling pathways that regulate cell morphology, including activation of the Rho GTPase family members RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 (Rose et al , 2007). The C19 antibody also showed that there was no change in PAK2 protein expression in PAK1−/− BMMs. Similar surface levels of the macrophage differentiation marker F4/80 (Hirsch et al , 1981) were observed in Wt and PAK1−/− BMMs, indicating that loss of PAK1 did not prevent CSF-1-mediated macrophage differentiation (Fig. PAK1 phosphorylation was increased by 2 minutes, and returned to basal levels by 10 minutes. However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was reduced in PAK1−/− BMMs after CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was reduced in PAK1−/− BMMs after CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was reduced in PAK1−/− BMMs after CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was reduced in PAK1−/− BMMs after CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1D), consistent with a role for PAKs in regulating the activity of kinases upstream of MAPKs, including c-Raf and MEK1 (Beeser et al , 2005; Frost et al , 1997; King et al , 1998; Zhang et al , 1995). 1D) or c-Raf on S338 (S. D. Smith and A. J. Ridley, unpublished), both described as PAK substrates, was not altered in PAK1−/− BMMs, indicating that deletion of PAK1 alone is not sufficient to affect these sites.PAK1 is required for chemotaxis but not translocation of leukocytes and HEK293 cells stimulated with ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors (Li et al , 2003; Wang et al , 2002). In contrast, PAK1−/− BMMs extended less stable lamellipodia upon adhesion which frequently collapsed back into the cell body (Fig. 3A, Supplementary movies 3 and 4). This is consistent with the time-lapse data indicating that PAK1−/− BMM lamellipodia are less stable and collapse before they can encompass large lengths of the cell perimeter. The group A PAKs are highly homologous, sharing 88% sequence homology within the p21-binding domain (PBD), which binds to Rac1 and Cdc42, and 93% homology within the kinase domain (Jaffer and Chernoff, 2002). MEK1/2 activity, as measured by phosphorylation of S217/221 (Alessi et al , 1994) was not altered in PAK1−/− BMMs before or 10 minutes after adhesion (Fig.
