Baseline salivary cortisol and self-reported state negative affectivity and state anxiety were first collected 5–10 min after laboratory arrival. Dispositional MeasuresMindfulnessThe 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003) assessed the frequency of open attentiveness to and awareness of present events and experiences using a 6-point Likert scale (almost always to almost never). Samples were collected via 2-min sublingual placement of synthetic Salivettes (Salimetrics, State College, PA) at baseline, immediately after the speech task (10 min from task onset), and 10, 20, and 35 min after the tasks (20, 30, and 45 min from task onset). Inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 6.69—6.88%, intra-assay CV was 3.88—7.12%, and the sensitivity was < 0.007 ug/dL.AnxietyThe POMS anxiety subscale assessed anxiety “currently” at baseline (α = .88), and at 10, 20, and 35 min after the tasks (20, 30, and 45 min from task onset).Negative affectivityThe NA portion of the PANAS assessed negative affectivity “right now” (baseline α = .87) on the same assessment schedule as with POMS anxiety. Among the participant covariates, later session times predicted lower cortisol responses [F(1,41) = 9.31, p = .004] and males reported higher NA [F(1,63) = 11.90, p = .001] and anxiety [F(1,62) = 9.77, p = .003]. Secondary AnalysesAmong the non-mindfulness dispositional measures and the baseline affect measures, separate mixed model analyses showed that only dispositional fear of negative evaluation predicted cortisol responses [F(1,40) = 4.24, p = .05]; those with lower scores showed elevated cortisol across conditions. Consistent with the mindfulness stress-buffering hypothesis, this experiment found that cortisol responses to a social evaluative threat task was moderated by dispositional mindfulness, such that more mindful individuals showed an attenuated cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test relative to a control task. However the stress buffering effects held when controlling for these study variables. Second, future research should control for rumination and other social anxiety indicators to rule out alternative interpretations of the findings, as both traits have been associated with both mindfulness (Brown & Ryan, 2003) and TSST cortisol responses (e.g., Zoccola, Quas, & Yim, 2010).
