Each substrate consisted of a 4 mm Au working A proximal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the potential from −0.8 to 0.0 V in 4 mV increments, with an amplitude of molecules used by bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to population cultures were grown in 6 mL of FAB medium with 30 mM glucose at 37 °C At pH values higher than its more negative redox peak is pH-independent, indicating that it involves a pure more negative redox peak is pH-independent, indicating that it involves a pure SERS Characterization of PYO as a Function of pH.In order to characterize the SERS spectra of PYO in a system poised for spectroelectrochemical measurements, a solution containing 500 C–H bending (with some C–N stretching contribution at 1355 peak near 1398 cm−1 at acidic pH values. ring, Scheme 1A, is disrupted in acidic These model compound data make it clear that the the decrease in intensity of the 1598 cm−1 peak ring deformation mode in the reduced form. changes very little with applied potential, making it possible to independently distinct from either fully oxidized or fully reduced forms. electrochemically, the biofilms were first formed in a test tube, and then electrochemically, the biofilms were first formed in a test tube, and then production, as shown in Figure between wild-type (wt) and mutant (Δphz) strains clearly indicates that wave obtained from PA14 wt. of the chemical messaging behavior of complex multicomponent biological FRD1 pellicle biofilms, grown in glucose, secrete significant amounts of PYO, as Moreover, the PC heat maps in Figure Moreover, the PC heat maps in Figure the PA14 wt analysis shows features near 1600 cm−1, which were identified in 2 as being associated with oxidizing local PCA of 120 h PA14 wt. PC1 presents distinct features at 1351, 1560, and 1627 cm−1, matches reasonably well with the phenazine ring analysis suggest that another component may be present in the FRD1 sample in potential control, that is EC–SERS, as shown in Figure 5. Major peaks are observed at 1227, 1307, 1361, 1410, 1574, and acquired under different redox conditions are the decrease in intensity of the under reducing conditions could plausibly arise either because the molecular components responsible for the bands are down-regulated and thus do not appear plays a role in explaining the potential-dependent behavior of the SERS Δphz mutant strains of P. aeruginosa under varying electrochemistry is a powerful tool for the characterization of the P. suggest that it may be possible to follow its behavior spectroelectrochemically. bacteria are sessile and encased by a matrix composed of extracellular polymeric conditions.16-19 However, EC detection provides relatively little chemical identification information,15 which is required for comprehensive chemical and robustness of EC detection with a more information-rich spectroscopy method to ability to identify elements of the bacterial secretome using the unique Raman applied extensively to studies of biological samples, and it is a particularly powerful tool for detecting and characterizing microorganisms.23,24 the chemical compositions of complex samples.25 Recently, SERS imaging of PYO from the P. numerous studies have successfully used Raman imaging to analyze secreted molecules order to identify mechanisms of chemical communication in heterogenous biological addition to SERS, other label-free, multiplex imaging techniques, such as mass voltammetric methods applied in situ, that is, under oxygen-rich conditions. high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with Pseudomonas 300R, WITec GmbH), as previously reported.10 Laser excitation at 532 nm was provided by a doubled
