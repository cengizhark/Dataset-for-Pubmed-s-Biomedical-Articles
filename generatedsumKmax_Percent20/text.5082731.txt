Tr1 cells are prevalent in children living in malaria-endemic regions (Jagannathan et al , 2014; Portugal et al , 2014; Walther et al , 2009), and results presented here not only demonstrate the emergence of Tr1 cells after resolution of first blood-stage P. falciparum infection but also show that the IL-10 produced by these cells potently suppressed parasite-specific, pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Patient clinical data for samples from Timika are shown in Table 2. Median parasitemia was 2,195 parasites/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 810.75–4640.25 parasites/µL), with 11 patients (92%) treated with artemisinin combination therapy and one patient (8%) treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. These include cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 10 (Couper et al , 2008; Plebanski et al , 1999) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (Omer and Riley, 1998; Walther et al , 2005), as well as immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 (Jacobs et al , 2002; Schlotmann et al , 2000), LAG-3 (Butler et al , 2011; Illingworth et al , 2013), PD-1 (Butler et al , 2011; Hafalla et al , 2012), and TIM-3 (Costa et al , 2015; Huang et al , 2013). Cryopreserved stocks of nRBCs and pRBCs were allowed to thaw on ice and then adjusted to a working concentration of 9 × 106 nRBCs or pRBCs/mL in complete media. As a positive control, 25 µL of a mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (PHA, final concentration 10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), was added into corresponding wells. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie near infrared (NIR) fixable viability kit (BioLegend) was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. Then, 1–5 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of surface antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min on ice, protected from light. Then, 1–5 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of surface antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min on ice, protected from light. Next, 100 µL of BD Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each well and incubated on ice for 20 min, protected from light. Then, 2 µg/mL (final volume of 50 µL) of intracellular antibody (IFNγ PeCy7 and IL-10 PE), diluted in BD Perm buffer was added per well and incubated on ice for 60 min, protected from light. PBMCs were re-suspended in a final volume of 100 µL of 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA; MP Biomedicals), stored at 4°C, and protected from light until acquisition on a laser (LSR) Fortessa 5 (BD Biosciences). Samples were generally acquired within 12–24 hr post-staining. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie NIR fixable viability kit was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. Then, 1–5 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of surface antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer and Brilliant stain buffer (Cat# 563794; BD Biosciences), added to each well, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, protected from light. Then, 5 µg/mL (final volume of 50 µL) of intracellular antibody (IFNα PE), diluted in BD Perm buffer, was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 45–60 min, protected from light. For the positive selection of CD4+ cells, after the first elution, the sample was loaded onto a fresh column and then underwent a second round of elution to increase the purity of selected population. RNA concentration and quality were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ.

Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. qPCRs were performed in duplicate, using the GoTaq qPCR kit for SYBR green (A6001; Promega) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad) per manufacturer’s instructions. A study of Ugandan children from areas of different malaria exposure indicated that burden of disease may have an important impact on number and function of Treg cells (Boyle et al , 2015). Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between groups were determined using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (day 0 versus day 7 or day 0 versus day 14), and the linear regression function was used to analyze associations between IL-10 or IFNγ levels and the AUC by GraphPad Prism v.6 for Windows; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, a study in malaria patients from the Peruvian Amazon showed that neither Treg cell frequency nor Treg cell number was associated with the risk of malaria-related symptoms (Torres et al , 2014), suggesting that alternative mechanisms of immune regulation may be important for controlling inflammation and thus preventing disease. In mice infected with Mycobacteria tuberculosis, type I IFNs suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by stimulating the production of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonists (Mayer-Barber et al , 2011; McNab et al , 2014). This revealed a significant inverse correlation between IFNγ levels and parasite burden (Figure 3C). Hence, type I IFNs produced during first exposure to P. falciparum suppressed the ability of parasite-specific CD4+ T cells to produce IFNγ. Thus, in addition to regulating CD4+ T cell responses during sub-clinical malaria, type I IFNs suppressed early inflammatory responses by innate immune cells following exposure to parasites. Type I IFNs Promote the Development of Immunosuppressive Antigen-Specific Tr1 Cells after Anti-parasitic Drug TreatmentTr1 cells have emerged as a dominant CD4+ T cell response in highly exposed children living in malaria-endemic regions (Jagannathan et al , 2014; Portugal et al , 2014; Walther et al , 2009). However, we cannot determine whether increased IL-10 at this time point indicates earlier immune suppression that allowed increased parasite growth or increased parasite burdens promoted the development of more Tr1 cells and/or IL-10 production. Type I IFNs have been shown to inhibit the activity of various innate immune cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (Auerbuch et al , 2004; Berry et al , 2010; Carrero et al , 2004; Desvignes et al , 2012; Parker and Prince, 2012; Stanley et al , 2007; Xin et al , 2010). Previous studies in mouse models of malaria showed direct suppressive effects of type I IFNs on tissue resident DC subsets, associated with changes in co-stimulatory molecule expression and increased DC IL-10 production (Haque et al , 2014). Furthermore, IL-6, along with TGF-β, is important for IL-17 production (Bettelli et al , 2006; Mangan et al , 2006; Veldhoen et al , 2006), and the suppression of both IL-6 and IL-17 identifies a major immunological axis regulated by type I IFNs during blood-stage P. falciparum infection. In the absence of type I IFN signaling blockade, parasite-specific IFNγ production 7 days after inoculation was no different from background levels detected before infection, consistent with little detectable inflammatory signature in subjects with sub-microscopic, pre-symptomatic P. falciparum infection at this time point.
