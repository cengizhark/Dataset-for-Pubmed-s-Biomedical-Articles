CYP3A4 RNA levels in the Adeno-3A4-infected cells (MOI 75) were similar to those found in 9L/3A4 cells.

In an effort to chemosensitize the cells to MMDX at lower Adeno-3A4 MOIs, cells were co-infected with Onyx-017, an E1B-55kd-deleted oncolytic adenovirus that selectively replicates in p53-deficient tumor cells and can be used as a helper virus to co-amplify and increase the expression and cellular transmission of replication-defective virus encoding CYPs 2B6 and 2B11 6, 34. This toxicity was also apparent from the body weight loss of 3–7 g seen for the 9L and 9L/3A4 tumor-bearing mice following i.v. Although a 2–4 g body weight loss was observed in the 9L/3A4 tumor-bearing mice on days 10 and 17 after the first i.t. Drugs such as vinca alkaloids and irinotecan are metabolized by CYP3A4 to less active or inactive metabolites 36, 37, whereas other anti-cancer drugs, including IFA 32, the bioreductive agent AQ4N 19 and the anthracycline MMDX, are metabolized by CYP3A4 to more toxic metabolites. The present study investigated whether CYP3A4 may be used together with the CYP3A prodrug MMDX for gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) applications in cancer.

The present study investigated whether CYP3A4 may be used together with the CYP3A prodrug MMDX for gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) applications in cancer. The strong chemosensitization of 9L/3A4 tumors to MMDX reported here further suggests that MMDX may be particularly active against tumors that express CYP3A4 endogenously, i.e., without the introduction of a gene therapy vector. Efforts to use retrovirus to increase the level of P450 reductase in 9L/3A4 cells were unsuccessful, and resulted in a decrease in CYP3A4 protein levels without an increase in MMDX toxicity (data not shown). A decrease in CYP3A4 protein content was also seen when P450 reductase was introduced into CHO/3A4 cells, although in that case a large increase in overall CYP3A metabolic activity was obtained (Fig. Supplementary Materials and MethodsMaterials, and methods used for Western blotting, P450 reductase assay, qPCR analysis, CYP3A4 adenovirus preparation and adenovirus-mediated RNA transcription, protein expression and enzyme activity are available on-line as Supplementary Materials. Thus, the impact of P450 reductase gene transfer on tumor cell capacity for P450 prodrug activation may be dependent on the endogenous tumor cell level of P450 reductase and its relation to the overall tumor cell P450 protein content following introduction of the gene therapy vector. Gene therapy vectors that give high levels of P450 expression (e.g., adenoviral vectors) 34 may be particularly demanding in terms of the requirement for P450 reductase, particularly in the case of CYPs that have a low apparent affinity for P450 reductase 50. Nevertheless, despite the very low concentration of MMDX, there is sufficient formation of the active MMDX metabolite to effect tumor cell killing. In contrast, IFA cytotoxicity required millimolar concentrations of prodrug, consistent with the Km (IFA) of ~ 1 mM exhibited by CYP3A4 32. Further work will be needed to develop strategies for increasing intratumoral CYP3A4 protein and activity in vivo, e.g., by taking advantage of the recently described stabilizing effect of NFκB on CYP3A4 protein 52, before this CYP3A4 gene therapy can be implemented in the clinic. Nevertheless, the present study provides proof-of-concept for the potential of CYP3A4 for prodrug activation-based gene therapy in the context of a high background of liver CYP3A activity.

P450-based GDEPT using cyclophosphamide-activating CYP2B enzymes improves intratumoral 4-OH-cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and enhances antitumor activity in vivo, with the greatest improvements obtained when cyclophosphamide is administered by directly intratumoral injection 53, 54. The present studies also highlight the importance of intratumoral, rather than hepatic, CYP3A4 expression for effective chemotherapeutic responses to MMDX in the absence of a gene therapeutic, and suggest that patient tumor biopsies should be screened for CYP3A4 protein levels to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from treatment with MMDX and perhaps other CYP3A4 prodrugs. After a second 24-h period, the culture medium, containing infectious retroviral particles, was gently removed with a sterile pipette and added to 9L gliosarcoma cells (5 × 105 cells in a 100-mm dish) in the presence of 4 µg/ml of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Quantitation of 4-OH-IFA production and active MMDX formation by tumor cells expressing CYP3A49L/3A4 cells were plated in 12-well culture plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 1.5ml culture medium. Cells remaining on the plate were washed with PBS and stained with crystal violet. Cells cultured in DMEM medium to 75% confluence were trypsinized and washed in PBS and then adjusted to 2 × 107 cells/ml of FBS-free DMEM. Other P450 prodrugs investigated in preclinical gene therapy studies include ifosfamide (IFA) 16, 17, an isomer of cyclophosphamide, and the bioreductive drugs tirapazamine 18 and AQ4N 19. Drug-free controls were injected i.t. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: V = π/6 (L × W)3/2. Retroviral expression of human CYP3A4 chemosensitizes 9L gliosarcoma cells to MMDX and IFARetrovirus encoding CYP3A4 cDNA was used to infect 9L tumor cells, which were selected based on their acquired resistance to puromycin. This potent cytotoxicity of activated MMDX contrasts with that of the CYP3A4 prodrug IFA, which required millimolar concentrations to kill 9L/3A4 cells (Fig. This potent cytotoxicity of activated MMDX contrasts with that of the CYP3A4 prodrug IFA, which required millimolar concentrations to kill 9L/3A4 cells (Fig.
