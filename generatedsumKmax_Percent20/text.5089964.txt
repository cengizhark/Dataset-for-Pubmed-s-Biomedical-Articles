In the management of IDH-mutant gliomas, aggressive surgery targeting all non-enhancing areas of disease remains the standard first-line treatment since, in low grade gliomas (which again are largely IDH mutant), a significant correlation has been demonstrated between maximal tumor resection and overall survival [11]. Long-term follow-up data of the randomized phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9402 [22] and the EORTC trial 26951 [23] demonstrated an improved outcome – in both progression-free and overall survival – in 1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors when procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy (PCV) was added to RT – for instance, in the RTOG 9402 trial the median survival of those with 1p/19q co-deleted tumors treated with PCV plus RT was twice that of patients receiving RT (14.7 v 7.3 years). Accordingly, IDH status was prognostic but not predictive in the retrospective analysis of the German Glioma Network NOA-04 trial, in which patients with anaplastic gliomas were randomized to receive first either RT or CT (PCV or temozolomide) and upon disease progression to receive the other treatment modality [24]. Hence, no statements can be made about the predictive implication of molecular markers in this patient group. Finally, novel methods directly targeting the IDH mutation itself hold significant promise for improving treatment of these gliomas. Finally, novel methods directly targeting the IDH mutation itself hold significant promise for improving treatment of these gliomas. Numerous further genomic alterations are strongly associated with IDH mutations – overlapping to define distinct subgroups of gliomas, including mutations of the TP53 gene and the alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) gene in astrocytic gliomas [2], whereas oligodendroglial tumors harbor more frequently mutations in the homologue of the Drosophila capicua gene (CIC), mutations of the far upstream element (FUSE) binding protein 1(FUBP 1), co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q [3, 4], and mutations in promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) [5, 6]. Whether the favorable prognosis seen in association with IDH mutation in gliomas is due to improved natural history or better response to therapy is unknown.
