Our finding that Nono functions as a bivalent chromatin factor in mESCs is consistent with this prediction.Our study shows that Nono interacts and co-localizes with Erk2 and RNAPIIS5P at bivalent genes in mESCs, while a previous study also reported that Nono binds both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RNAPII CTD at Ser5 (Emili et al , 2002). Since Nono is reported to bind mRNAs and required for mRNA processing in differentiation cells (Clemson et al , 2009; Fox et al , 2002; Fox and Lamond, 2010; Hutchinson et al , 2007; Li et al , 2009; Sunwoo et al , 2009), it is conceivable that such a mechanism may be critical for Nono-bound bivalent genes to produce mature mRNAs once mESCs leave the primed state to differentiate. It will also be of importance to evaluate whether this mechanism is conserved in the regulation of ESCs of human and other species.In summary, our findings highlight a function for Nono in mESCs where it plays a critical role at the chromatin interface to regulate Erk signaling, impacting the integrity of bivalent chromatin at developmental genes and mESC pluripotency. DNA deep sequencing analyses were performed at the Epigenetics Key Laboratory at IBS of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.For ChIP-seq data processing, the FASTQ data were mapped to mouse genome(mm9) using Bowtie, and significant enrichments (peaks) were identified by MACS 1.4 using Broad Peak mode with P value≤1×10−5, FDR≤0.01 as a cutoff from the mapped reads (Zhang et al , 2008).A total of 3,104 bivalent genes are classified by the overlap of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 with mapping tags > 50 and fold enrichment > 8 compared to input (Marks et al , 2012). Nono KO mESCs show increased expression of Nanog and KLF4 with enhanced self-renewal capacityAs discussed, the para-speckle structure is absent in mESCs but Nono nonetheless is expressed and has been suggested to regulate transcription of Oct4 (Park et al , 2013), raising the possibility that Nono may play a role in regulating mESC pluripotency. Importantly, GO analysis identified a significant enrichment of Nono bound genes in the category of transcription regulation and developmental genes (Figure S2A and S2B), including Pax9, Tbx3, Cdx2, Gata4 as well as all Hox clusters of genes, which are known to be decorated and regulated by bivalent domains (Bernstein et al , 2006; Vastenhouw and Schier, 2012) (Figure 3D). Erk2 interacts and is required for Nono localization to a subgroup of bivalent genesAlthough most Nono bound genes carry bivalent modifications, only a small portion (~12%, 381/3,104) of total mESC bivalent genes are bound by Nono (Figure 3F and S2C), suggesting that bivalent state alone does not define Nono chromatin association. As shown in Figure 4I (left), PD03 treatment not only caused a reduction of Erk2 binding as previously reported (Tee et al , 2014), but also a significant reduction of Nono binding at these bivalent genes (Figure 4I, right). Consistently, we further found a substantial local reduction of pErk1/2, but not total Erk2, at bivalent genes (Figure 5B), suggesting that the activation but not chromatin occupancy of Erk is regulated by Nono. This is similar but not identical to Mek/Erk inactivation mediated by PD03, which results in an impaired chromatin occupancy of both phosphorylated Erk as well as total Erk protein (Tee et al , 2014). Through genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses, we found the highest level of RNAPIIS5P at Nono/Erk bound bivalent genes, as well as a significant reduction of RNAPIIS5P but not total RNAPII at bivalent genes (Figure 6A), similar to Erk inhibited mESCs (Tee et al , 2014). However, a much milder reduction of RNAPIIS5P at the Nono/Erk unbound bivalent genes was also detected, suggesting a possible involvement of additional mechanisms.Since the expression of many bivalent genes needs to be activated upon differentiation, we further investigated Nono function in bivalent gene activation upon RA-induced differentiation. Nono loss compromises mESC differentiationWe next investigated whether Nono null cells also exhibit compromised ability to undergo differentiation as a result of an impaired Erk activity and compromised activation of Nono/Erk co-bound bivalent genes. Additionally, although Nono KO teratomas were able to develop all three germ layers (Figure S4B), they by and large gave rise to much smaller ectoderm-derived, keratinized epithelium tissues (Figure S4B, left) and fewer mesoderm-derived muscle tissues (Figure S4B, middle), but no obvious alterations of endoderm-derived intestinal epithelium tissues (Figure S4B, right).It’s important to note that, consistent with our molecular findings that Nono and Erk reciprocally regulate each other, Nono KO mESCs behaved similarly as the PD03 treated (Figure S4C and S4D) and Erk2 KO mESCs (Kunath T et al , 2007), in our EB and monolayer NSC differentiation assays.Taken together, we find that Nono KO mESCs displayed many similarities to 2i “ground state” and PD03 treated mESC in terms of the robust self-renewal capability, resistance to differentiation as well as epigenomic and transcriptomic features.
