To compare the potency of the signaling molecules within each membrane, the extracted protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the growth factor and cytokine loads were normalized to the total extracted protein from either amnion or chorion. Fresh chorion contained more growth factors and cytokines per cm2 compared with amnion, likely due to the overall increased thickness compared with amnion. While previous studies have evaluated the cytokine content within the placental membrane for specific commercial products6–9 and have investigated the effects of processing on the amnion,10,11 there is a lack of literature comparing the cytokine content of the amnion and chorion and evaluating how these tissues are altered by dehydration. The purpose of this study is to compare the growth factor and cytokine content found within the amnion and chorion layers and to determine the effects of dehydration on these signaling molecules. Fresh chorion contained more of some signaling molecules per cm2 compared with amnion, and both dehydrated samples saw a significant drop in total growth factor and cytokine content (51.1% ± 20.2% for amnion; 55.5% ± 37.3% for chorion).
