While a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in mTRPA1-transfected cells revealed activation at concentrations below 100 μM menthol, Ca2+ levels declined in a concentration-dependent manner above 100 μM. 2B, left panel, green trace). 2C, upper left panel green trace; upper right panel, current at +120 mV shortly after application of menthol). However, many of these sensory chemicals have been shown to be promiscuous, affecting more than one thermoTRP. The Region Spanning Transmembrane Domain 5 and Transmembrane Domain 6 (TM5-TM6) Determines the Distinct Sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to MentholTo systematically identify the molecular basis underlying the distinct sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to menthol, we constructed chimeras between the two channels. In contrast, hTRPA1-mTM1-6, a chimera constructed by introducing the transmembrane region from mTRPA1 into hTRPA1 (Fig. In FLIPR, mTRPA1-hTM5-6 was activated by menthol with an EC50 of 43.9 ± 6.4 μM and it was not significantly inhibited by menthol (Fig. TRPA1 is a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of non-selective cation channels, many of which are involved in sensing diverse chemical and physical stimuli (Clapham, 2003; Dhaka et al , 2006; Voets et al , 2005). Human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) and Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 (dTRPA1) full length cDNA were cloned in pcDNA5/FRT vector, while TRPA1 from Takifugu (Fugu-TRPA1) and Anopheles gambiae (Mosquito-TRPA1) were cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector. In calcium imaging, 250 μM menthol neither activated mTRPA1-dTM5 nor produced an “off” response during its washout (Fig. These results were corroborated in FLIPR experiments (Fig. 4D, E); MO responses were similar to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 4D, E); MO responses were similar to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 4D, E); MO responses were similar to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 4D, E); MO responses were similar to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 4D, E); MO responses were similar to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig. Strikingly, mTRPA1-S876V/T877L completely lost its menthol sensitivity while retaining a relatively normal MO response (Supplementary Table 2) as assayed by both calcium imaging and FLIPR (Fig. We also made the corresponding mutant in hTRPA1 (hTRPA1-S873V/T874L, in which the corresponding Ser-873 and Thr-874 of hTRPA1 were mutated to Val and Leu of Drosophila). We also made the corresponding mutant in hTRPA1 (hTRPA1-S873V/T874L, in which the corresponding Ser-873 and Thr-874 of hTRPA1 were mutated to Val and Leu of Drosophila). 6B-E and Table 1).Sequence alignment of TRPA1 from different species revealed that TRPA1 from Anopheles gambiae (mosquito-TRPA1) and Takifugu (fugu-TRPA1), like dTRPA1, do not have Ser and Thr at these two positions (Fig. On the other hand, the responses of these mutants to ruthenium red, an external pore blocker, and HC030031 remained normal (Table 1).We further tested AP18 on mTRPA1 and its mutants. The optimized mTRPA1 homology model was used for molecule docking calculations. These modeling results put forward the hypothesis that TM5 contributes directly to a binding pocket. However, the apparent consistencies between experimental and modeling results by no means constitute evidence for binding. Menthol is best known to elicit a cooling sensation in humans (Eccles, 1994). While the biological significance of acquiring menthol sensitivity(with different pharmacological profiles) in mammalian TRPA1 remains unclear, the unique menthol response profiles of various TRPA1 orthologs enabled a chimeric structure-function approach from which three major conclusions can be drawn. In mammals, TRPA1 is expressed in nociceptors and functions as an important component of the pain transduction machinery (Jordt et al , 2004; Story et al , 2003). In mammals, TRPA1 is expressed in nociceptors and functions as an important component of the pain transduction machinery (Jordt et al , 2004; Story et al , 2003). One hypothesis is that the TM5 domain may constitute a binding site for menthol. Our modeling and docking studies reveal a putative menthol-binding site in TM5 regions. We also made a series of mTRPA1-dTRPA1 chimeras. Regardless of its direct involvement in menthol binding or in gating, the TM5 domain critically determines the ability of TRPA1 to sense menthol. The residues at these positions in TRPA1 from non-mammalian species are α-helix favoring (Val and Leu), which may preclude this proposed mechanism. Interestingly, Chen et al  have recently found that CMP1, an electrophilic reactive compound, activates mTRPA1 but inhibits hTRPA1 (Chen et al , 2008). Interestingly, Chen et al  have recently found that CMP1, an electrophilic reactive compound, activates mTRPA1 but inhibits hTRPA1 (Chen et al , 2008). Chen et al  argued that the covalent modification of cysteines in TRPA1 by MO is rapidly reversible. Single mutations L894F, P897A, S900T, I905L, V942I, S943A, and I946M did not measurably affect menthol sensitivity of hTRPA1 in this calcium imaging assay (data not shown).

A,B, mTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (A,0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (B, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). B (inset): Tail current analysis reveals voltage dependence of activation of mTRPA1-dTM5 that is qualitatively similar to wild type (Macpherson, Dubin et al  2007). B (inset): Tail current analysis reveals voltage dependence of activation of mTRPA1-dTM5 that is qualitatively similar to wild type (Macpherson, Dubin et al  2007). G, hTRPA1 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (G, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (H, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). I, J, hTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell attached patch configuration (I, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette/ 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (J, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). AP18 does not form glutathione adducts as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)ESI-MS spectra of glutathione (GSH) alone (A) or reacted with either MO (B) or AP18 (C). When reacted with MO, glutathione adducts of predicted mass were observed (336 + 99 = 435) (B). When reacted with MO, glutathione adducts of predicted mass were observed (336 + 99 = 435) (B). In most experiments studying menthol block of TRPA1 activation, a Ca2+ containing extracellular saline was used (2 mM Ca2+ ES) which contained (in mM): 136 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In some experiments, the pipette contained 100 nM free Ca2+ buffered by BAPTA (1 mM): 130 methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl2, 0.483 CaCl2, 1 BAPTA-K salt, 10 hemi Na-HEPES (pH7.3 with CsOH).TRPA1 activity was usually monitored using repetitive voltage ramps (at 5 sec intervals) in the whole cell configuration. To quantify the effects of TRPA1 modulators on TRPA1 activity, averaged inward currents at -120 mV and averaged (over the first ∼5 msec) outward currents at +120 mV were measured (see Fig. Cells in whole cell configuration were challenged with a voltage step protocol to investigate the current-voltage relationship for TRPA1 activation by voltage. Prior to rupturing the patch to achieve a whole cell recording, voltage protocols were applied to the cell-attached patch and voltage-dependent activation of TRPA1 channel activity was monitored (Supplementary Fig. In addition to these reactive chemicals, numerous non-reactive organic chemicals have also been shown to activate TRPA1, such as icilin (Story et al , 2003), trinitrophenol (Hill and Schaefer, 2007), farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) (Maher et al , 2008), and clotrimazole (Meseguer et al , 2008). Briefly, equimolar concentrations of TRPA1 modulators and glutathione (Sigma) were mixed in water and reacted at room temperature for two hours. The complex was subject to molecular dynamics simulation under periodic boundary conditions (90 Å × 90 Å × 100 Å). That was followed by 150 ps of constant volume and subsequent 1 ns of constant pressure molecular dynamics (MD) run at 310 K. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained via the SHAKE algorithm. To function as a broad polymodal nocisensor, it is conceivable that TRPA1 has employed multiple mechanisms for sensing chemically diverse compounds signaling a broad repertoire of chemicals. All simulations were performed using the NAMD software package (Phillips et al , 2005) with a charm27 force field. Each MD simulation was run in parallel distributed over 16 processors and required on average one week to complete a 1-ns MD simulation run.The optimized complex was used for docking calculations with Glide 2.6 (Shelley et al , 2007). Farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). For preparing stock solutions, trinitrophenol and ruthenium red were dissolved in H2O. Mutating specific cytoplasmic cysteine residues markedly impaired the sensitivity of TRPA1 to those reactive compounds. Menthol activated hTRPA1 (Fig.
