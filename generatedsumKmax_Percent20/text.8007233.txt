Haemin injection significantly induces the expression of Hrg1 gene in most organs (P < 0.05), which was strongly dependent on Nrf2 in most organs (Fig 5A). Organ failure due to accumulated injury from persistent haemolysis (Gardner et al, 2016) and sickling remains one of the major causes of death in patients with SCD (Vichinsky, 2017). Exposure to extracellular haem further increased the transcript level of Hmox1 in these organs, with an unexpected strongest induction in the kidney and the heart of SS mice, which had lower baseline expression. Although Nrf2 depletion ubiquitously blunted haemin-induced Hmox1 levels, the magnitude of the Hmox1 reduction varied in the different organs, suggesting the presence of additional unknown mechanisms that control Hmox1 expression. Organ damage in SCD is a multifactorial process and different organs may be affected in distinct ways by primary events, such as haemolysis and circulating non-haemoglobin bound haem. Similarly, Pgf heart levels in haemin injected Nrf2+/+ animals rose higher than all other organs. Similarly, Pgf heart levels in haemin injected Nrf2+/+ animals rose higher than all other organs. We have previously reported the association between Pgf, inflammation, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and high mortality in patients with SCD (Perelman et al, 2003; Sundaram et al, 2010). Kolakowski et al , (2006) reported that direct intramyocardial injection of PGF following a large myocardial infarction attenuated adverse ventricular remodelling and improved myocardial function. PGF contributes to cardiac hypertrophy (Dewerchin & Carmeliet, 2012, Eiymo Mwa Mpollo et al, 2016, Roncal et al, 2010), through intermediate paracrine growth factors such as interleukin 6 (Accornero et al, 2011; Dewerchin & Carmeliet, 2012), which is known to be elevated in the serum of SCD patients (Taylor et al, 1995; Qari et al, 2012; Sarray et al, 2015). Furthermore, we investigated the role of Nfe2l2 (also termed Nrf2) in the organ-specific transcriptional response pattern of Hmox1, Pgf and Hrg1. A recent investigation of blockade of PGF suggested beneficial effects in SS mice (Gu et al, 2018). Some of the mice received sterile vehicle (0.25 mol/l NaOH adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl used in preparation of haemin) as a control.

The isolated splenocytes were incubated in 5 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mmol/l NH4Cl, 14 mmol/l NaHCO3 and 127 mmol/l EDTA) for 5 min at 8°C and washed twice with PBS. The isolated splenocytes were incubated in 5 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mmol/l NH4Cl, 14 mmol/l NaHCO3 and 127 mmol/l EDTA) for 5 min at 8°C and washed twice with PBS. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysates using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Catalogue number 217004, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and quantified using the Nanodrop 8000 micro-volume spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Relative quantification was calculated with the standard ΔΔCt method; amplification signals from target gene transcripts were normalized to those from beta-glucuronidase (Gusb) transcripts. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalogue number 23225) was used to quantify total protein in the lysates. HMOX1 and PGF protein quantificationHeart HMOX1 and PGF concentration were measured using the mouse HMOX-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and the PGF ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Surprisingly, the heart showed 18-fold induction of Hmox1, implying an unexpected capacity of the heart to take up haem and induce its degradation pathway. Surprisingly, the heart showed 18-fold induction of Hmox1, implying an unexpected capacity of the heart to take up haem and induce its degradation pathway. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of Pgf in the organs of SS mice, and determined that there was heterogeneity (P < 0.0001, Fig 1E) in basal Pgf expression in these mice, surprisingly with the highest expression in the heart (DeltaCt 2.9 ± 0.3), lung (3.1 ± 0.2) and kidney (5.0 ± 0.6). The strong inducibility of Hmox1 expression by haem in liver and kidney was expected, but comparable level of haem inducibility of Hmox1 in the heart is a novel observation. Organ-specific haem induction of Hmox1 is largely Nrf2 dependentThe Nrf2 gene regulates the basal and inducible expression of Hmox1 and to understand the mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in the haemin-induced organ-specific Hmox1 expression, we utilized Nrf2 null mice.

HMOX1 and PGF proteins are highly inducible by haem and Nrf2-dependentWe confirmed at the protein level the strong cardiac inducibility of HMOX1 and PGF expression in the heart tissue lysates 3 h after haem injection. In the same heart lysates, PGF protein as a percentage of total heart protein increased by about 22% (P < 0.01), 29% (P < 0.05), and 18% (P < 0.01) in SS, Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice respectively (Fig 3B).
