LimitationsThere are several limitations to the results of this study. InstrumentationThe subjective importance of smoking (SIMS).The SIMS is a 14-item measure developed to assess the psychological importance of cigarettes and cigarette smoking to a smoker. Results suggested that the SIMS is poorly suited for smokers smoking < 10 cigarettes/day.The SIMS was next administered to a sample of 202 Southeastern Pennsylvania adult daily cigarette smokers with no intention to quit (Mean age 31 years, SD = 8.07) taking part in a study to better understand their opinions on tobacco product advertising (Strasser et al , 2011). Although there was greater variability than the Quebec sample, the response probabilities for several items were highly skewed to ‘False’ (six-point False-True scale). We assessed nicotine dependence as it should be positively and strongly correlated with SIMS given cigarettes are nicotine delivery devices.Psychological correlates.The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (20 items) was used to assess positive and negative affect (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), Alpha = 0.823; the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (14 items) was used to assess anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure) (Snaith et al , 1995), Alpha = 0.933; The 21-item Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to assess Anxiety symptoms (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988), Alpha = 0.885. ESEM is a structural equation modelling (SEM) method that allows researchers to combine exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a single model (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009; Marsh et al , 2009). The process involves several steps. We used SPSS 24 software for descriptive statistics and Mplus 7.0 software for the ESEM analysis.Given the ordinal nature of the SIMS variables, model parameter estimation employed a weighted least squares estimation technique (WLSMV) with robust standard errors, and a mean and variance adjusted chi-square (χ2) test statistic (Muthén, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997; Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2004). We evaluated our multivariate models for fit to the observed data using multiple indicators of model performance, including the χ2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), weighted root mean square residual (WRMR), standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (Jackson, Gillaspy, & Purc-Stephenson, 2009), along with substantive criteria (e.g., interpretability of factors). To account for missing data, Mplus estimates mean, variance and covariance parameters using a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimating procedure which employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, assuming data are missing at random (Muthén, 1998–2004a; 1998–2004b). Thus, cases with missing data on the covariates are not included in the analysis. Given only one eigenvalue > 1 (λ1=8.339) accounting for 60% of the variance, along with a scree plot (eigenvalue plot) elbow at 2 (also suggesting one factor), and 12 loadings ≥ 0.60, we selected the single factor solution as the best solution for these data. Indeed, findings of such research suggest that becoming a non-smoker involves adopting a non-smoker identity (Lindgren et al , 2016; Tombor, Shahab, Brown, & West, 2013; Tombor et al , 2015; Vangeli & West, 2012). The purpose of the present study was to assess whether negative feelings about the self, associated with smoking, moderated the effect of the SIMS on PPA at 24 weeks post quit in a sample of participants involved in a NRT treatment study. When coupled with other findings supporting the possible role of self-conceptions and identity in the smoking cessation process (Berg et al , 2010; Gibbons & Gerrard, 1995; Lindgren et al , 2016; Pulvers et al , 2013; Shadel & Mermelstein, 1996; Tombor et al , 2013; Tombor et al , 2015; van den Putte et al , 2009; Vangeli & West, 2012), this finding supports recommendations for a more comprehensive program of research to identify the role of self-conceptions related to substance use behaviours (Lindgren et al , 2016). Self-concept formation involves identifying with activities that become important to the individual (Wigfield & Karpathian, 1991).
