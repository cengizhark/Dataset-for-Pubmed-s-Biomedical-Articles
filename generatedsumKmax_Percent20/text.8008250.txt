As an internal program review for performance improvement, the study was exempt from institutional review board (IRB) review. Given the selection bias associated with requesting a palliative consult, we used propensity score matching to identify a representative control cohort. Central line blood stream infections are also a component of the Medicare hospital-acquired condition program; however, during data verification, an error was identified in how these data were extracted to the data warehouse and it had to be excluded from the analysis. As of 2012, greater than 60% of hospitals with at least 50 beds reported having a palliative care team.1 In the United States, palliative care expansion is driven by a recognition that 25% of healthcare expenditures occur in the last year of life and do not have associated improvements in patient quality of life.2 By shifting focus toward patient goals and preferences, palliative care consultation improves symptom control and quality of life, and reduces costs.3 In our population, the palliative care group maintains higher total hospitalization charges, likely driven by the longer time spent in the ICU and a greater overall hospital LOS. In contrast, there were higher rates of dialysis, C-diff infection, MRSA bacteremia, and total ventilator hours. In both developed and developing countries, there is a struggle to fund palliative care as it can be difficult to fully measure the true avoided costs associated with a palliative care consult.4-6 There further is limited economic evidence or research in palliative care to help programs understand how to get their systems to provide supportive funding.7 Given varying funding structures, individual programs will have to think creatively about how they can document value for their program. On the value-based outcomes, there is no longer a difference in readmission rates, while higher rates of dialysis, C-diff, MRSA, and ventilator hours persist. The key metrics will vary across international payment systems, but this study provides a roadmap for analyzing metrics once those key metrics are identified.
