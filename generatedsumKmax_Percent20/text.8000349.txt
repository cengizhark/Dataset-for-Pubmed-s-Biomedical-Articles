All in all, the data support the view that the JK-Loop is highly dynamic in the absence of the substrate.The CO photolysis induced substrate and ligand migration in the hIDO1-CO-Trp complex is consistent with previous spectroscopic data showing that ligand dissociation in hIDO1 significantly weakens substrate binding.30 It is also in good agreement with flash photolysis studies suggesting that CO dissociation from the heme iron (induced by visible light) triggers the relocation of the substrate from the active site to an unknown binding site, which retards the unimolecular rebinding of the CO to the heme iron.39 The structure of the hIDO1-CO-Trp* complex reported here provides the first glimpse of this previously unidentified binding site, Sa*, where the bound Trp partially blocks the return passage of the CO, accounting for the retarded CO rebinding kinetics. This substrate and ligand binding trajectory supports the previously proposed scenario that during enzyme turnover O2 binds to the heme iron prior to substrate binding.30,40 It suggests that during turnover the Sa* site functions as a transient docking site to guide the sequential entry of the ligand and substrate, while the JK-LoopC operates as a gate to dynamically control the entry processes.Flash photolysis induced CO migration in heme proteins, in particular myoglobin (Mb), has been extensively studied as a mean to understand reversible ligand binding processes.41-45 Visible light illumination of Mb-CO crystals at cryogenic temperatures was shown to trap photochemical intermediates, where CO docks in a variety of well-defined docking sites.42-45 Temperature-dependent studies revealed that CO migration following photolysis is limited to the distal heme pocket because of restricted protein motions under the frozen conditions, while at a relatively higher temperature (>180 K) the photolyzed CO can further migrate to the proximal side of the heme because of the opening of additional ligand migration tunnels resulting from increased protein conformational freedom.45The CO photolysis reaction reported here represents a unique case where CO photolysis triggers large-scale translocation of not only the photolyzed CO but also the bulky substrate Trp, which is accompanied by a large conformational change to an active site loop, the JK-LoopC. Recent crystallographic studies surprisingly revealed that hIDO1 and hTDO share a similar active site structure, albeit possessing distinct overall protein folds.14-16 Resonance Raman and computational studies suggest that the two enzymes follow an analogous two-step dioxygenase mechanism (Figure 1).17-19 The reaction is initiated by radical addition of the ferric heme iron bound superoxide to the C2 of the Trp to generate an alkylperoxo transition state. To address this question, we employed optical absorption spectroscopy to interrogate the conformational plasticity of the active site in hIDO1 vs hTDO using three structurally diverse inhibitors—PF-06840003 (IPD),48 epacadostat,16,49 and NLG91950—as structural probes (Figure 5A).The substrate-free CO complexes of hIDO1 and hTDO display similar spectral features, with the Soret maximum at ~420 and two visible bands at ~540/570 nm, characteristic for CO–heme complexes, while Trp binding introduces only small changes to the spectra, similar to those reported previously.26,51 The replacement of Trp with the inhibitors in either hIDO1 or hTDO introduces minor perturbations to the spectra, except that IPD binding in hIDO1 induces a large shift of the Soret maximum to 430 nm and the merging of the two visible bands into a single band at 560 nm, indicating the dissociation of CO from the heme iron (Figure 5B). The hIDO1 protein is active toward various indoleamine derivatives, while hTDO is specific for Trp.3 The hIDO1 protein is easily autooxidizable during enzyme turnover,25 while hTDO can turn over continuously without losing any electrons.26 The inactive ferric derivative of hIDO1, but not hTDO, can be activated by binding superoxide to generate the active ternary complex, thereby sustaining the enzyme turnover.27-29 Substrate binding in hIDO1 retards ligand binding to the heme iron,30 while that in hTDO facilitates it.31 The activity of hIDO1 is directly regulated by substrate inhibition through binding a second Trp in an inhibitory binding site on the proximal side of the heme;16 in contrast, the activity of hTDO is regulated at the protein level by controlling the lifetime of the protein through binding a second Trp in an exosite that is ~40 Å away from the active site15.
