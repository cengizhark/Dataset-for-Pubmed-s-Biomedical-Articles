Focal brain lesions may trigger structural and functional changes in perilesional and remote brain regions.1 Functional neuroimaging studies showed that neural activity in ipsilesional and contralesional cortical areas was pathologically increased when stroke patients moved their paretic hand,2 and that overactivity usually decreases over time, concomitant to clinical recovery.2,3 Modulation of cortical networks by pharmacological means or by noninvasive brain stimulation was demonstrated to ameliorate stroke-induced deficits.4-7 For example, the enhancement of monoaminergic influences via amphetamine in combination with physical therapy facilitates functional improvements after focal brain injury in rats, monkeys, and humans.8-11 Data are, however, inconclusive, as several clinical trials could not confirm positive effects of amphetamine for motor recovery in humans.12,13 The beneficial effects of amphetamine for the facilitation of motor recovery may result, at least in part, from interactions with the noradrenergic system.14-16 Recent studies in healthy humans revealed that modulating the noradrenergic system with reboxetine (RBX), a selective noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor,17 increases motor cortex excitability and improves motor learning as well as the performance in complex visuomotor tasks.18,19 Likewise, motor performance of stroke patients may be improved via noradrenergic stimulation with RBX.20 The neural mechanisms underlying such NA-mediated motor improvements, however, remain to be elucidated. This hypothesis is supported by results from a clinical trial which showed that patients with less motor impairments showed the best behavioral response to amphetamine.63 Therefore, increases in SMA-M1 coupling might promote improvements in motor performance under RBX stimulation, but this is not the only factor influencing a positive behavioral response to RBX. Such facilitated gating of neural information after NA stimulation has also been observed in electrophysiological experiments in animals and may underlie enhanced motor performance of the paretic hand after RBX stimulation in the current study.25 It is important to note, however, that the RBX-improved motor performance of stroke patients observed in the current and a previous study represents a short-term effect.20 In animals, repeated administration of RBX induced a stronger increase in extracellular NA than a single dose of reboxetine did,72 and also increased the affinity of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.73 In addition, repeated administration of the alpha-1 receptor agonist methoxamine increased the density of cortical synapses.74 These long-term administration-induced adaptive changes in the noradrenergic system might consolidate the behavioral improvements induced by a single dose of stimulation and thereby induce long-lasting functional improvements. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was applied to fMRI data of key motor areas to assess the effects of RBX on interregional connectivity within the cortical motor system.23 We hypothesized that RBX-mediated improvements of motor performance in stroke patients might result from a normalization of abnormally increased neural activity in both hemispheres,3,4 which might be caused by enhanced coupling of neural activity between motor areas mediated by noradrenergic stimulation.24,25 They were subsequently normalized to MNI space using the SPM software by applying the deformation parameters derived from the respective T1 images. A similar RBX effect was observed for the tapping performance during fMRI (PBO [mean ± SD] = 2.83 ± 1.48Hz; RBX = 3.30 ± 1.62Hz; t(10) = 4.058, p < 0.05, FDR corrected).The VLSM analysis revealed no significant relationship between lesion location and RBX-mediated improvements in grip strength or finger-tapping frequency. In addition, there was no significant difference in motor performance or response to RBX between patients with (ie, the 4 patients with BDI scores ≥ 9) and patients without symptoms of depression (ie, BDI scores < 9) (p > 0.05).There were no significant RBX effects on any motor parameter of the unaffected hand (p > 0.05). When patients moved their paretic hand after RBX administration, task-related neural overactivity was significantly reduced in a number of areas in both hemispheres including ipsilesional vPMC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Fig 4; Table 3).Furthermore, we investigated BOLD signal changes in a priori defined ROIs representing key areas of the motor system so as to enhance statistical sensitivity. Neuroimaging studies have shown that these areas are typically involved in tasks relying on motor learning.54 In these studies, practice-induced improvements in task performance are usually associated with a reduction of neural activity in frontotemporal areas, probably owing to less cognitive effort for practiced tasks.55,56 Similar processes might explain the reductions in BOLD signal observed for areas in the prefrontal cortex and the temporal cortex when patients were stimulated with RBX (ie, reduced demands upon motor control as a result of improved motor performance). Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that the sensorimotor areas along the central sulcus and SMA exhibit a high density of NA-containing fibers in both monkeys and humans.60-62 Therefore, manipulating the NA system by means of RBX might be especially effective for connections targeting the sensorimotor regions, such as the SMA-M1 interactions.Although increased coupling of ipsilesional SMA-M1 was not correlated with improved affected index finger-tapping frequency, the improvement in finger-tapping frequency was correlated with ARAT scores.
