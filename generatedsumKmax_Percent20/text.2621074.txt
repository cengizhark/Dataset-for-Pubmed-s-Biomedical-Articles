Treatment with OSM led to rapid JAK-1 and JAK-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 was detected at 15 min, which persisted for 1 h in the case of STAT-1 (Fig. Modest induction of SOCS-1 mRNA was observed upon treatment with OSM, which was elevated in the STAT-3 siRNA cells at 1 h (2-fold), 2 h (2.2-fold), and 4 h (6.2-fold) (Fig. Also, compensatory roles of STAT-1 and STAT-3 have been proposed, such that enhanced activation and signaling of one STAT protein occurs when the other is absent or downregulated (Costa-Pereira et al  2002). These results indeed support such a hypothesis.To further investigate the role of STAT-3 in SOCS-3 expression, the effect of a dominant-negative STAT-3 construct (STAT-3F), which contains an inactivating phenylalanine substitution at a critical tyrosine residue (Nakajima et al  1996), on OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity was tested. We recently demonstrated that induction of SOCS-3 by LPS in macrophages and microglia depends on the production of IL-10, STAT-3 activation, as well as activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways (Qin et al  2007). We have recently demonstrated that the MAPK pathways are involved in LPS-induced expression of SOCS-3 in macrophages and microglia (Qin et al  2007). Concentrations of 1 μM and above significantly inhibited SOCS-3 mRNA expression, and maximal inhibition was seen at 20 μM (Figs. OSM is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines which also includes IL-6, IL-11, LIF, CNTF, CT-1 and novel neurotrophin-1/B-cell stimulating factor-3 (NNT-BSF-3) (Heinrich et al  2003). OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity requires AP-1 and GAS elementsThe SOCS-3 promoter contains a number of cis-regulatory elements including three AP-1 sites, one NF-κB element, two GAS elements, and others (Auernhammer et al  1999; Gatto et al  2004; Qin et al  2007). Deletion of the region containing the medial AP-1 element (Δ3), and an NF-κB and Sp1 site (Δ4) had no significant effect on OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity compared with the WT construct. In construct Δ5, deletion of the proximal AP-1 element reduced OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity by ~48% compared with Δ4. Deletion of the distal GAS element (GAS #1) (Δ6) did not significantly affect OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity compared to Δ5. The main signaling pathways activated by OSM are the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription (JAK/STAT) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) (Extracellular Signal Related Kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), and p38) pathways (Gomez-Lechon 1999; Korzus et al  1997; Repovic et al  2003a). As well, the proximal Sp1 element is deleted in construct Δ7.Activated STAT protein complexes bind to GAS elements in the promoters of STAT-responsive genes (Bromberg and Darnell 2000). Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate individual mutations in each of the GAS elements to better define their contributions in SOCS-3 promoter activity (Fig. Mutation of the distal GAS element (GAS #1) decreased OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity by ~48%, whereas mutation of the proximal GAS #2 element reduced activity by 40%. c-Fos and c-Jun are AP-1 transcription factors downstream of the MAPK pathways (Turjanski et al  2007). To determine histone modifications in response to OSM, ChIP assays were performed using Abs against the acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4. ChIP assays were also performed for the recruitment of RNA Pol II to the SOCS-3 promoter. OSM has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation (Halfter et al  2006; Hurst et al  2002; Langdon et al  2003; Repovic et al  2003a; Repovic et al  2003b; Weiss et al  2006). The SOCS-3 promoter contains many regulatory elements including three AP-1 sites and two GAS elements (Gatto et al  2004; Qin et al  2007). Removal of the proximal AP-1 site (Δ5) decreased OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity by 48%, and deletion of both the distal and proximal GAS elements (GAS #1 and #2) and the proximal Sp1 site (Δ7) completely eliminated activation of the SOCS-3 promoter by OSM (Fig. Within the Δ4 construct, mutation of the proximal AP-1 site led to a 22% decrease in OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity, whereas mutation of GAS #1 caused a 48% decrease, and mutation of GAS #2 led to a 40% decrease (Fig. These results indicate that all three elements, proximal AP-1, GAS #1, and GAS #2, are important for optimal OSM-induced SOCS-3 promoter activity. A rat model of neurite outgrowth in primary sensory neurons demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated delivery of SOCS-3 inhibited neurite growth. However, it is important to consider that SOCS-3 has also been shown to inhibit signaling by the growth hormone receptor, insulin receptor, focal adhesion kinases and src family kinases, among others (Baetz et al  2004; Cacalano et al  2001; Johnston 2004; Liu et al  2003). The pharmacological inhibitors for MEK-1/MEK-2 (U0126), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), JAK-2 (AG 490) and negative control compounds (U0124 and SB202474), were purchased from Calbiochem Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The structure of the SOCS proteins consists of a central SH2 domain, a C-terminal 40 amino acid motif termed the SOCS box, and an N-terminal region of variable length. Briefly, ten μg of total RNA was hybridized with the riboprobes at 56°C overnight. The hybridized mixture was treated with RNase A/TI (1:200) and then separated by PAGE on a 5% denaturing (8 M urea) gel. Membranes were stripped for 30 minutes at room temperature in buffer containing 100 mM 2-ME, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) with continuous shaking, and reprobed with antibodies against JAK-1, JAK-2, STAT-1α, STAT-3, p44/42, JNK1, c-Jun, p38, or actin. The deletion constructs are named as follows: Δ1, which lacks the distal AP-1 and C/EBP site; Δ2, which lacks two GATA-1 elements and a p300 site; Δ3, which lacks the medial AP-1 element; Δ4, which lacks two Sp1 sites and an NF-κB site; Δ5, which lacks the proximal AP-1 site; Δ6, which lacks the distal GAS element; and Δ7, which lacks the proximal GAS and Sp1 elements. Astrocytes (1 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates and incubated with DharmaFECT 1 reagent alone or with 100 nM cyclophilin B, siCONTROL or STAT-3 specific siRNAs following the manufacturer’s recommendations. After 72 h of transfection, 30 μg of cell lysate was subjected to immunoblotting for cyclophilin B, STAT-3 and actin as described above. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated with 200 mM NaCl at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-links. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated with 200 mM NaCl at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-links. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated with 200 mM NaCl at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-links. The primer pair 5′-GCTTTGTCTCCCTCTCGGTGAGT-3′ and 5′-AGTGTAGAGTCAGAGTTAGAGCC-3′ was used to amplify a 230-bp region in the mouse SOCS-3 promoter containing the proximal AP-1 element, two GAS elements, and an Sp1 element. In addition, studies have shown that SOCS-3 inhibits signaling of other cytokines/stimuli including LPS, LIF, IL-2, -3, -4, IFN-γ and IFN-α (Elliott and Johnston 2004; Hanada et al  2003; Kubo et al  2003; Qin et al  2006b). OSM activates the JAK/STAT pathway in primary astrocytesOSM utilizes several signaling pathways to regulate gene expression, including the JAK/STAT pathway (Gomez-Lechon 1999; Korzus et al  1997; Van Wagoner et al  2000).
