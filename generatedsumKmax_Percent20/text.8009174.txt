Found C, 62.20; H, 5.40; N, 10.06.Continued elution gave the β-linked derivative 11b as colorless syrup 11.3 g, 9.2%. HRMS (ESI-TOF): m/z [M+Na]+ calcd for C22H25O4N3SNa 450.1463, found 450.1459.Continued elution gave the β-linked glycoside 7b as colorless syrup (2.1 g, 1.8%, Total 99.4 g, 86% overall, α/β ∼ 46:1). Red color developed immediately and, after 20 min, when TLC (Solvent 1, Rf = 0.72 at 4:1 hexane–EtOAc. The residue was chromatographed (10:1 hexane– EtOAc) and title compound 14 was obtained as colorless syrup (47.9 g, 94%), [α]D +23.8 (c 1.0, CHCl3). TMSOTf (4.7 mL, 26.1 mmol) was added, whereupon red color developed immediately. An additional advantage of the approach described here is that the stereoselectivity of the critical glycosylation reaction, which converted the terminal determinant to a conjugation-ready form, was substantially increased by controlling it thermodynamically.2, 6 The crude product was passed through a short pad of silica and elution with 5:1 hexane–EA afforded pure 4 as white solid. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, when TLC (Rf = 0.57 at 4:1 hexane–EtOAc) showed complete consumption of starting material and formation of a faster moving product.

In contrast with the unsuccessful Lewis acid mediated reaction of 11 or 12 with 2-trimethylsilylethanol, the BF3·Et2O-catalyzed reaction of 11 with ethanethiol readily produced ethyl 4-azido-2-O-benzoyl-3-O-benzyl-4,6-dideoxy-1-thio-α,β-d- mannopyranoside (7a and hitherto unknown 7b),11 which was fully characterized.

The material was sufficiently pure for the next step.Method 1:To a solution of the hexasaccharide trichloroacetimidate donor 21 (100 mg, 0.04 mmol) and glycosyl acceptor 22 (35 mg, 0.2 mmol) in dry DCM (7 mL) was added 0.1 g of 4 Å powdered molecular sieves, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Chromatography (3:2 toluene–acetone) gave first the α-linked hexasaccharide (2a, 132 mg, 66%) as colorless syrup.

TLC showed complete consumption of starting material and presence of a much more polar product. Coupling of disaccharide acceptor 6 and thioglycoside donor 7a in presence of NIS-TMSOTf at 0 °C produced trisaccharide 15 (93%, Scheme 3). Zemplén debenzoylation of 15 furnished trisaccharide acceptor 4, which was obtained crystalline (CCDC No 1939745). Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. In this case, the conformations of the polysaccharide chains of the two independent molecules are more likely to reflect a conformational energy minimum for the chain, then would be the case if extensive hydrogen bonding were present. That the predominant isomer contained the desired α-configuration followed from the 13C-1H coupling constant for the 13C carbon involved in the newly formed interglycosidic linkage. In most situations across carbohydrate chemistry, synthesis of the 1,2-trans-glycosidic linkage is not problematic because a participating group can be introduced into 2-positions of the glycosyl donors. One of our major targets has been a conjugate vaccine for cholera from synthetic fragments of O-SPs of Vibrio cholerae.1–3 We have modified existing approaches leading to antigenic determinants of Vibrio cholerae O1 and verified scalability of reactions involved. Intermediates to oligosaccharides in this series, up to and including the hexasaccharide have been successfully prepared on multigram scales.
