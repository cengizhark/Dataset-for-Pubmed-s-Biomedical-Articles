From baseline to eight weeks, insomnia severity on the ISI (scale 0–28) decreased 9.9 points in women receiving CBT-I and 4.7 points in women in the menopause education control group, for a mean between-group difference of −5.2 (95% CI: −6.1, −3.3; P<0.001).12 Sleep quality measured with the PSQI (scale 0–21) improved from baseline to eight weeks by 4.0 points in women receiving CBT-I and 1.4 points in women in the control group, for a mean between-group difference of −2.7 (95% CI: −3.9, −1.5; P<0.001).Insomnia symptoms and subjective sleep quality were assessed as secondary outcomes in the first three MsFLASH trials, providing unique information about the effects on sleep of escitalopram, yoga, exercise, omega-3 supplements, low-dose oral estradiol, and venlafaxine in women with hot flashes. Moderate but significant reductions in insomnia symptoms were seen with escitalopram compared to placebo, exercise and yoga compared to usual activity, and venlafaxine compared to placebo.9, 11, 16, 17 Improvements in sleep quality were significantly better than control with escitalopram compared to placebo, exercise compared to usual activity, and estradiol compared to placebo.11, 16, 17In a pooled analysis of individual-level data from all MsFLASH participants with baseline ISI ≥ 12 from the first four trials (Figure 2), CBT-I was the most effective of all MsFLASH interventions at reducing insomnia symptoms (ISI) and improving sleep quality (PSQI).3 A clinically significant improvement in sleep disturbances at menopause has not been established. In MsFLASH 04, CBT-I ISI scores dropped nearly ten points, but the between-group difference was 5.2 points, which although statistically significant, doesn’t reach the 6-point threshold.18 Similarly, PSQI scores dropped four points in CBT-I, but the between-group difference was 2.7, just below the 3-point threshold.19Vaginal symptomsBothersome vaginal symptoms are observed in 40–70% of midlife women and are particularly bothersome in late menopause.5 The primary outcome of our fifth RCT was bothersome vaginal symptoms; we evaluated an FDA-approved 10 mcg vaginal estradiol tablet and an OTC vaginal moisturizer, compared to placebo tablet and gel.The MsFLASH Vaginal Health Trial did not find significant benefit from use of a 10 mcg vaginal estradiol tablet or a vaginal moisturizer compared to placebo tablet and gel in diminishing the severity of vaginal symptoms (Figure 3).5 In women who reported moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal itching, dryness, irritation or pain with sexual activity at baseline, all treatment groups had similar mean reductions in the severity of their most bothersome symptom (scale 0–3) over twelve weeks: estradiol −1.4 (95% CI: −1.6, −1.2), moisturizer −1.2 (95% CI: −1.4, −1.0), and placebo −1.3 (95% CI: −1.5, −1.1; P=0.25 estradiol vs. placebo, P=0.31 moisturizer vs. placebo). There was no overall benefit or harm of treatment with escitalopram, venlafaxine, oral or vaginal estradiol on sexual function (total Female Sexual Functioning Index, FSFI), but minor effects on FSFI domains should be mentioned. The placebo effects for vasomotor symptom frequency included a 33% decrease at eight weeks in the escitalopram trial, a 36% decrease (supplement placebo arm) and a 33% decrease (usual activity arm) at twelve weeks in the omega-3, exercise, and yoga trial, and a 29% decrease at eight weeks in the estradiol and venlafaxine trial.4, 8, 9–11, 30 In all trials, clinically relevant improvements with placebo accrued throughout the treatment period with a time course similar to the observed improvements in the active arm.Placebo effects on insomnia symptoms and sleep quality were equally pronounced for behavioral and medical interventions. Our design was unique in providing a double-placebo, including an inert tablet matching the active estradiol tablet and an inert gel matching the active vaginal moisturizer. Hot flash interference,4 sleep quality, insomnia symptoms,16 and quality of life24 improved, and overall sexual function did not change.22 For escitalopram vs. placebo, the mean difference in hot flash frequency reduction was 1.41 (95% CI: 0.13, 2.69; P<0.001) fewer hot flashes per day.8Exercise (individual, facility-based aerobic training three times/week for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, but did modestly improve sleep quality compared to usual activity control.11 The intervention did not measurably affect quality of life.25Yoga (weekly 90-minute classes and 20-minute daily home practices four times per week for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, but did slightly improve quality of life and reduce insomnia symptoms9, 25 compared to usual activity control.Omega-3 supplement (1.8 gm daily for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, nor did it improve sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, quality of life, or mood, compared to placebo.10, 25Venlafaxine XR (75 mg daily for eight weeks) had similar effects to Oral Estradiol (0.5 mg) on VMS frequency, an approximate 50% decrease from baseline compared to placebo.4 Venlafaxine XR improved insomnia symptoms and low-dose oral estradiol improved sleep quality, compared to placebo.17 Both venlafaxine and low-dose estradiol modestly improved hot flash interference4 and quality of life.26 There was no change in overall sexual function with either venlafaxine or low-dose oral estradiol, relative to placebo, although venlafaxine decreased sexual pain but resulted in diminished orgasm, and low-dose oral estradiol improved desire.23 For venlafaxine vs. placebo, the mean difference in hot flash frequency reduction was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.7; P=0.005) fewer hot flashes per day. From baseline to eight weeks, the ISI (scale 0–28) decreased 9.9 points in women receiving CBT-I and 4.7 points in women in the menopause education control group, for a mean between-group difference of −5.2 (95% CI: −6.1, −3.3; P<0.001).12Vaginal 10 mcg estradiol tablet (nightly for two weeks, then twice weekly for ten weeks), did not provide any added benefit over a dual placebo (vaginal gel + tablet) in reducing vulvovaginal discomfort, improving sexual function, or sexual activity in postmenopausal women.5 However, a modest improvement in menopausal quality of life was observed with vaginal estrogen, driven by the sexual domain.27 Changes in most bothersome symptom (MBS): Estradiol −1.4 (95% CI: −1.6, −1.2) and placebo −1.3 (95% CI: −1.5, −1.1; P=0.25).Vaginal moisturizer (three times per week for twelve weeks) did not provide any added benefit over a dual placebo (vaginal gel + tablet) in reducing vulvovaginal discomfort, improving sexual function, or sexual activity in postmenopausal women.5 No improvement in menopausal quality of life was observed.27 Changes in MBS: −1.2 (95% CI: −1.4, −1.0) and placebo −1.3 (95% CI: −1.5, −1.1; P=0.31).
