Notably, TCR Tg mice have been generated for the P. yoelii CD8 T cell determinant [27]. Notably, TCR Tg mice have been generated for the P. yoelii CD8 T cell determinant [27]. Plasmodium-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells have also been generated, but the MHC class II-restricted TCR is specific for a blood stage antigen (MSP-1) and the epitope is only expressed by P. chabaudi rodent parasites [28–30]. More recently, Heath and colleagues developed a new TCR Tg mouse line bearing CD8 T cells responsive to an antigen expressed during both blood and liver stage [31]. (2) endogenous T cell responses can be studied without knowledge of specific Plasmodium antigens/epitopes or MHC class I or MHC class II restriction elements; and (3) any combination of inbred or outbred mouse strains and Plasmodium parasite species can be studied. Of note, methods for immunizing rodents with live attenuated Plasmodium parasite vaccine platforms have been previously covered [46,47], so our chapter will only describe methods for examining T cell responses induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination. The surface antigen antibody cocktail should include anti-mouse-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2), anti-mouse-CD8α, anti-mouse-CD11a, anti-mouse-CD4, anti-mouse-CD49d, anti-mouse CD90 and cell viability dye.Mix with pipetting and incubate the plate at 4°C for 20–30 min.Wash away unbound antibody and/or tetramer from wells by adding 150 μl of FACS buffer directly to wells containing staining cocktail, spin plate at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Decant or aspirate supernatants, lightly vortex plate, add 100 μl of Cytofix and incubate at 4°C for 7–10 min (see Note 16).Wash away Cytofix from cells by adding 150 μl of FACS buffer directly to wells containing 100 μl of fixative, spin plate at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Decant or aspirate supernatants, lightly vortex, suspend cells in 180–200 μl of FACS buffer, then store cells at 4°C protected from light until run on the flow cytometer.3.1.2 Measuring responses in spleen or lymph node tissueThis section describes the isolation and flow cytometric staining of lymphocytes recovered from secondary lymphoid tissues of mice immunized with pre-erythrocytic vaccines.Harvest desired secondary lymphoid tissues using sterile scissors and forceps and place tissue into 15 mL conical containing 3 mL of RPMI-1640 medium.Transfer the tissue and medium onto a fine mesh steel screen in a 15 × 60 mm (or 10 × 35 mm) tissue culture dish. Suspend cells in 3 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer to the 15-mL conical, vortex, and incubate at RT for 30–60 seconds.Add ~11 mL of FACS buffer (fill tube), centrifuge samples at 3–400 × g for 5 min in 4°C tabletop centrifuge (see Note 10 if performing functional analyses).Aspirate or decant supernatant, suspend pellet, wash residual red blood cell lysis buffer from cells by adding 5 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Aspirate or decant supernatant, suspend pellet in 10 mL (for spleen cells) or 1–3 mL (for lymph node cells) of FACS buffer.Determine total numbers of viable cells using hemocytometer, microscope with 40× objective and Trypan Blue exclusion dye.Adjust the cell concentration to 10–20 million viable cells/mL (see Note 18).Add 100 μl of cell suspension into wells of 96-well flat-bottom plate (see Notes 2 and 13).Centrifuge plate at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C in a tabletop centrifuge.Decant or aspirate supernatants (see Note 14), lightly vortex plate to disrupt cell pellets.Stain cells with appropriate staining cocktail(s):If examining CS-specific CD8 responses using CS252-260 or CS280-288 MHC class I tetramer, cell staining should be performed sequentially:First, add 50 μl of the optimally titrated tetramer reagent, mix with pipetting and incubate at RT, 4°C or on ice for 1 hour (see Note 15).Second, without washing cells directly add 100 μl of a cocktail of antibodies directed against cell surface antigens. Next gate on the antigen-experienced (CD8αloCD11ahi) CD8 T cells by examining CD8α expression and CD11a expression on the X- and Y-axis, respectively.Optional—the fraction of CD8αloCD11ahi CD8 T cells that are CS-specific can be determined by examining the fraction of antigen-experienced CD8 T cells that bind the MHC class I tetramer by viewing CD8α on the X-axis and tetramer on the Y-axis (Figs.
