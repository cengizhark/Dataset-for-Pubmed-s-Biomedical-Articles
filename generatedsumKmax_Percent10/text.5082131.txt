C57BL/6j and Balb/C mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Nano-aAPC were manufactured by direct conjugation of MHC-Ig dimer and anti-CD28 antibody (37.51; BioLegend) to MACS Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described previously14. Nano-aAPC were manufactured by direct conjugation of MHC-Ig dimer and anti-CD28 antibody (37.51; BioLegend) to MACS Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described previously14. Enrichment and ExpansionNano-aAPC were stored at a concentration of 8.3 nM (5×1012 particles/mL), and all volumes refer to particles at this concentration. 10 million CD8-enriched lymphocytes at ~108cells/ml were incubated with 10 μl of nano-aAPC for 1 hour at 4°C, for an approximate bead:cell concentration of 5000:1. The methods used to prepare libraries for analysis on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument are described in (47). This 17-amino acid peptide sequence was then processed by NetMHCpan version 2.4 to identify moderate (<500nM) to high (<50nM) affinity 9-amino acid peptides for all H-2d alleles. Full protein sequences were determined from Uniprot.org, from which nine flanking amino acids upstream and downstream of each mutation were extracted. Each 19-amino acid sequence was processed by NetMHC versions 3.4 and 3.2 to determine H-2b binding affinity of potential 8-, 9-, and 10-amino acid binders. A list of top candidate epitopes was compiled based on the epitope meeting either of the following criteria: 1) moderate to high affinity predicted binding affinity to H-2b allele, or 2) higher mutant peptide immunogenicity relative to the wild type peptide, based on the work of Castle, et al Mice were treated both the day of and the day after adoptive transfer with 30,000 units intraperitoneal IL-2. Tumor growth was monitored at 2-day intervals using digital calipers, with volume calculated using an ellipsoid approximate, volume = ½ × length × width. To assess efficacy of enrichment prior to culture, a known number of Thy1.1+ pmel TCR transgenic T cells specific for Db-GP100 melanoma antigen were mixed at a 1:1000 ratio with Thy1.2+ CD8 T cells from wild type B6 mice. These ~17-amino acid sequences were then processed by NetMHC, an algorithm that predicts binding of peptides to human HLA as well as mouse MHC alleles using an artificial neural network48. This algorithm predicted amino acid neo-epitopes 8 to 10 amino acids in length for CT26 and B16 (Supplementary Table 2). Peptide affinity for MHC as predicted by NetMHC (Supplementary Table 2) did not accurately predict E+E response; strong responders YTG and VDW had low predicted affinities at 991 and 9066 nM respectively, whereas the non-responder LAY and equivocal responder IAM had high predicted affinities at 69 and 5 nM respectively. Overall, the total number of cells generated at Day 7 approximated those observed with the shared antigens Db-GP100 and Ld-A5, ranging from 15,000 – 40,000 (Figure 4c), but was less than the shared antigens Kb-TRP2 and Kb-SIIN.
