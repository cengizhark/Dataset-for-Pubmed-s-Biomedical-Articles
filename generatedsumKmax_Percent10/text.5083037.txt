Thus, the high-functioning group exhibited deficits in the higher-order association cortex (regarding both functional and structural connectivity), while exhibiting no differences in the primary sensory and motor cortices. Social impairmentSix studies have reported negative correlations between RS connectivity and social impairment in ASD subjects (reported as negative correlations with the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Reciprocal Social Interaction score or ADOS–Social Scale score).19,22,30,31,33,55 The connections involved in four of these studies were between the following: PCC and temporal lobe, posterior parahippocampal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus;31 PCC and right superior frontal gyrus;30 PCC and right medial temporal gyrus;22 and right hemisphere motor cortex and thalamus.55 The other two studies reported negative correlations between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the synchronization between left and right hemisphere inferior frontal gyri,19 and between ADOS–Social Scale scores and the total precuneus connectivity z-scores.33 Kewon and colleagues56 reported a negative correlation between average local degrees of connectivity, the number of other regions to which the ROI connected, and social impairment (reported as a negative correlation with ADOS–Social Scale scores). A study by Assaf and colleagues33 also points toward lower ADOS communication scores with increasing precuneus connectivity z-scores, and Maximo and colleagues46 reported the ADI-R communicative score to be positively correlated with local connectivity within multiple cortical regions.Among the DTI studies, a study by the Nagae group75 reported a negative correlation between mean diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and Clinical Evaluation for Language Fundamentals–4 scores, whereas a study by the Billeci group76 found a similar negative correlation between left arcuate fasciculus mean diffusivity and expressive language ability only in the typically developing group. For example, only two studies reported correlations with social impairment,55,61 and only one study reported any correlation with severity of restricted/repetitive behaviors.87 Even though five studies looked at correlations with language/communication skills, one of these studies looked only at the correlation with local connectivity within different ROIs,86 another at the correlation with the length of streamlines within the superior longitudinal fasciculus,76 and yet another at the correlation with the hemispheric asymmetry quotient.83 Again, while it is possible that structural connectivity changes are predictive and specific for the behavioral profiles in these subjects, the literature has yet to reach a consensus on these matters.

In addition, as a spatial average of potentially many discrete directional components that may be present within a voxel, the average direction of the tissue in a voxel may not match any of the specific orientations that reside within. Bulk changes in cerebral hemodynamics associated with changes in neural activity associated with specific tasks can be localized by using well-designed behavioral tasks that tease apart the component functions associated with the specific tasks (task-based fMRI). From these primary tabulations of the literature, we sought to express the observed major findings in a more directly comparable manner. The imaging parameters varied widely. The imaging parameters varied widely. The gender ratio also varied widely, from all-male groups to mixed-gender groups.
