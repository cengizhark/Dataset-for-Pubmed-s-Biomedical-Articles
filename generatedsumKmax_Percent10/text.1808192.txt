For this reason, innate immune system receptors are believed to recognise a far lower diversity of molecules than MHC molecules or immunoglobulins. The signal peptides were predicted using the program SignalP 3.0 (Bendtsen et al  2004). The glucanase homology domain was taken from Kim et al  (2000). It is therefore of interest to compare the molecular evolution of innate immune system molecules that bind directly to pathogens with the patterns observed in MHC and immunoglobulin molecules. Following the recommendation of McDonald (1998), we used the three different statistics (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, the number of runs, and the mean sliding G) for detecting heterogeneity, as each is most powerful in different situations. We assumed that in D. simulans N = 2 × 106 and in D. melanogaster N = 106 (Andolfatto and Przeworski 2000). This analysis was based on published phylogenies of these species (((((melanogaster,simulans),(yakuba,erecta)),ananassae),pseudoobscura),(mojavensis,virilis)) (Ko et al  2003; Powell 1997). Previous studies on the molecular evolution of two families of Drosophila immune receptors have produced contrasting results. In the Anopheles gambiae aTepI gene, the C3d-like domain is very polymorphic (Blandin et al  2004). These ratios are significantly different in TepI (Table 3). However, we did look for variation within each of the genes, and in TepII the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio was significantly heterogeneous using both the D. simulans and the D. melanogaster datasets (D. melanogaster, mean G=15.4 [p<0.001], number of runs=183 [p=0.006], K-S=0.03 [p=0.03]; D. simulans, mean G=6.49 [p<0.03], number of runs=235 [p=0.22], K-S=0.04 [p=0.001]). The carbohydrate-recognition and glucanase-homology domains are candidate sites of host-parasite coevolution, as they have been found to bind directly to various parasite-associated polysaccharides in the GNBPs of other insects (Fabrick et al  2004). Vertebrate immune system receptors such as MHC molecules and immunoglobulins are very specific in the parasite-derived epitopes that they bind to. Only about 0.2% of the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster has occurred since the split of European and African populations (David and Capy 1988; Lachaise et al  1988). This study combined with previous work means that the molecular evolution of four different classes of molecules that bind to the surface of pathogens and illicit an immune response have been studied. Similar explanations have been proposed to account for the rapid evolution of other Drosophila immune system molecules (Begun and Whitley 2000).The evolution of GNBPs has been examined in both termites and Daphnia (Bulmer and Crozier 2005; Little et al  2004). Consistent with this, some other components of the immune system are positively selected in termites but not Drosophila (Bulmer and Crozier 2004; Jiggins and Kim 2005). Intriguingly, the sequence of the 280-amino acid-long C3d domain of aTepI is very variable, and it has been postulated that this may be responsible for variation in the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria (Blandin et al  2004). GNBP1 together with another pattern-recognition molecule, called PGRP-SA, is required to activate the Toll pathway in response to infection by gram-positive bacteria (Gobert et al  2003). It has also been reported that loss-of-function mutants in another gene, GNBP3, are sensitive to fungal infection, although the primary data to support this have yet to be published (Ferrandon et al  2004). One of these (CG13422) is also upregulated following fungal infection (De Gregorio et al  2001). Polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans for GNBP1 and part of TepI have previously been collected by Schlenke and Begun (2003). For this reason we only used inversion-free chromosomes for sequencing. In the sample from Gabon, 8 of 21 2L chromosome arms had inversions, and 10 inversion-free lines were retained for sequencing. In the Netherlands lines, all 16 of the 3L chromosome arms inspected were inversion-free, and 12 of these were retained for sequencing. Of 14 Netherlands 2R chromosome arms inspected, 13 were inversion-free. Despite this limitation, the innate immune response can recognise and eliminate a broad array of pathogens and parasites.
