Post hoc tests did not reveal a significant difference between these two doses of TH1020. Here we successfully characterized HMGB1 as a TLR5 ligand (Figure 1 & 5) and demonstrated HMGB1-induced TLR5 activation is NF-κB-driven (Figure 2 & 3) and releases downstream proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 4) Notably, we also showed that activation of peripheral TLR5 by HMGB1 and flagellin induces pain following subcutaneous administration in rats (Figure 6A & B). Our NMR data suggest that the C-terminal acidic tail (residues 185-215), the basic linker-region (residues 170-184), few residues of the N-terminus and the A-(residues 14-83) and B- (residues 88-164) boxes of full-length HMGB1 are critical for binding and activation of TLR5 by HMGB1 (Figure 5). Although a few residues of the A- and B-boxes of the HMGB1 tailless mutant show significant chemical shift perturbation, the rest of the residues in these domains are almost structurally identical with the full-length protein (Figure S4A, green labels and Table S1) confirming that the tail region is primarily interacting with the drTLR5 ECD. The media was removed from the 96-well plate and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (neither 1% penicillin/streptomycin nor 1% L-glutamine) and treated with the appropriate concentration of compounds. On day 3, 90 µL media was transferred to a black 96-well plate and 10 µL of 0.05 mg/mL 2, 3-diaminonapthalene (Sigma Aldrich, MO) in 0.62 M HCl were added to the media. The Fmoc-protected amino acids (0.5 mmol), HATU (0.5 mmol) and DIPEA (0.5 mmol) in 4 mL DMF were mixed with Rink Amide resin (0.1 mmol) with a substitution level of 0.45 mmol/g for the coupling step. SDS-PAGE was performed in MOPS running buffer at 175V for 1.25 h at 4°C. Protein was transferred onto a nitro-cellulose membrane by electroblotting and probed with the primary p65 antibody (1:400) provided in the kit. Protein was transferred onto a nitro-cellulose membrane by electroblotting and probed with the primary p65 antibody (1:400) provided in the kit. Anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, MA) at 1:2000 dilution was used followed by visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. ELISAELISA was performed using a kit from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) to measure TNF-a and IL-8 expression levels. Protein overexpression was induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Fluorescence anisotropy assayApparent Kd values were determined by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of 200 nM or 5 µg/ml fluorescein-labeled HMGB1 as a function of increasing concentrations of drTLR5 ECD and MD-2 proteins. The labeled protein was incubated with varying amounts of the target protein (drTLR5 ECD and MD-2) for 30 mins at room temperature in binding buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). NMR SpectroscopydrTLR5/HMGB1 interactions were determined by solution NMR spectroscopy on the CBP- and 6X His tags containing full-length and tailless 15N uniformly labeled HMGB1 proteins ranging from 80–100 µM, 10% (v/v) 2H20 in 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM deuterated DTT. Titrations of 1:1 and 1:2 (mol/mol) drTLR5/HMGB1 (CBP- and 6X His tag containing) were used All spectra were collected either in a Varian 800 MHz or 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with triple resonance cryoprobe at 25°C housed at Univ. To determine whether peripheral TLR5 functionally contributed to allodynia, either 0 (vehicle control), 3, or 10 µg flagellin was administered (100 µl; saline vehicle). Statistical analysisAnimal study: Mechanical allodynia was analyzed as the interpolated 50% thresholds (absolute threshold). Differences between treatment groups were determined by unpaired student’s t-test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. oxPAPC efficiently inhibited both PAM2 and LPS-induced activation of TLR2 and TLR4 (Figure 1B) without significant cellular toxicity at 30 µg/ml (Figure S2A). With 30 ug/ml oxPAPC, we observed a significant inhibition of TNF-α secretion upon PAM2- and LPS-mediated TLR2 and TLR4 activation but no effect on flagellin-induced TLR5 stimulation, suggesting the specificity of oxPAPC to TLR2 and TLR4. C-terminal tail of HMGB1 interacts with TLR5To determine the binding affinity and structural basis of the HMGB1-TLR5 interaction, fluorescence anisotropy and NMR spectroscopy were performed on the complex of full-length HMGB1 and the recombinant zebrafish Danio rerio ortholog of TLR5 (drTLR5) extracellular domain (ECD). By contrast, no interaction was observed between HMGB1 and the control protein, bovine serum albumin.The binding mode of the drTLR5-HMGB1 interaction was further elucidated by solution NMR spectroscopy.
