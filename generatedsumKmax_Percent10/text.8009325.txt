4B, p > 0.05) or entorhinal cortex volume (Fig. Moreover, biomarkers derived from blood are more accessible and have advantages over CSF or brain imaging biomarkers. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of AMPKα1 as a biomarker is not so high, which could also be due to the sample size. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementia syndrome, and one of the leading causes of disability and casualty in elderly [1, 2]. The specific targets and exact roles of the two AMPKα isoforms in the central nervous system have not been determined yet [14, 28-30]. Neuropsychological assessment batteries, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Logical Memory test II and Category Fluency test, were conducted by trained nurses. MRI scanning was carried out to measure the thicknesses of related corti and volumes of hippocampus and entorhino cortex using the program FreeSurfer [32]. Due to loss of follow-up, data of neuropsychological test, CSF biomarker and MRI scanning were incomplete. Those without the follow-up data were excluded from linear regression analysis. All the statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad 5.0. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Demographic and clinical characteristics of subjectsDemographic and clinical characteristics of those subjects are shown in Table 1. In Category Fluency test, subjects are asked to produce as many words as possible from a category in 1 min [34]. ROC analysis can give corresponding sensitivity and specificity at a specific point and can determine the best cut-off point for a biomarker.
