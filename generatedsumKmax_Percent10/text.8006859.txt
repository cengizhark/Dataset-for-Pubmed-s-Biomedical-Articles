This is consistent with the fact that p-TEFb (cyclin T1/Cdk9) associates with different partners besides SEC (e.g., BET domain proteins) (Luo et al , 2012a), and further implicates that the Pfn1/SEC interaction is mediated directly by the PLP motif in ENL. Importantly, endogenous Pfn1 showed a narrow size distribution that overlaps with both ENL and p-TEFb (Figure 5F). As the first actin-binding protein identified decades ago (Carlsson et al , 1977), the role of Pfn1, the ubiquitously expressed Pfn isoform, has been well demonstrated in cytoplasmic actin polymerization (Jockusch et al , 2007) and underlies its essentiality for many eukaryotic organisms (Balasubramanian et al , 1994; Verheyen and Cooley, 1994; Witke et al , 2001). Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Interestingly, our analyses suggested that XPO6 level is preferentially associated with the survival of lymph-node-positive breast cancer patients. Our prior study suggested that the anticancer activity of Pfn1 stems from its poorly understood nuclear functions that are spatially separate from its essential cytoplasmic functions (Diamond et al , 2015) and requires interaction with at least one nuclear protein containing the poly-L-proline (PLP) motif (XP ≥ 5; X = G, A, I, S, L) (Holt and Koffer, 2001). The SEC has been extensively studied for its role in productive transcriptional elongation (He et al , 2010; Lin et al , 2010; Sobhian et al , 2010). ENL was recently identified as an acetyl-lysine-binding protein, joining the BET family proteins as an epigenetic reader (Wan et al , 2017). Though largely unexplored in cancer, XPO6 mRNA level is a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer (Hao et al , 2016). Primary antibodies for ChIP include rabbit anti- p-Rpb1(Ser2) (CTD) (Cell Signaling, #13499), rabbit anti-Cdk9 (Cell Signaling, #2316), rabbit anti-cyclin T1 (Cell Signaling, #81464), rabbit anti-ENL (Bethyl lab, A302-268A), rabbit anti-H3K36me3 (Cell Signaling, #4909) antibodies. Mouse anti-BrdU antibody for immunofluorescence staining (B2531) was purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence staining include rabbit anti-Pfn1 (Abcam, ab124904). Silent mutations resistant to shPFN1 #1 and #2 were introduced in human Pfn1 cDNA by QuickChange: AGC to TCG (nucleotide 253-255) and TTG to CTC (nucleotide 367-369). Briefly, 30 μl samples were mixed with 200 μl UA buffer consisting of 8M urea (Sigma, U5128) in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and added to Microcon YM-30 filter units (Millipore, MRCF0R030). Samples were spun for 15 min at 14,000 x g and washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer by centrifugation at the same speed for the same length of time. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min, washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer, and 60 μL of sequencing-grade trypsin (Sigma, #11418025001) (200-400 ng total) in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the filter units. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min, washed twice with 100 μl UA buffer, and 60 μL of sequencing-grade trypsin (Sigma, #11418025001) (200-400 ng total) in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the filter units. 50 μl of 0.5M NaCl was added to the filters, centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min. A 200 ng to 1μg portion of sample was loaded (typically, 2-10 μl of sample was injected) into column with 98% mobile phase A. A 200 ng to 1μg portion of sample was loaded (typically, 2-10 μl of sample was injected) into column with 98% mobile phase A. For Data dependent acquisitions, mass spectra and tandem mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion and high-sensitivity mode. Advanced information-dependent acquisition (IDA) was used for MS/MS collection on the TripleTOF 5600 to obtain MS/MS spectra for the 20 most abundant parent ions following each survey MS1 scan (allowing typically for 80 ms acquisition time per each MS/MS). Search parameters were set to an initial precursor ion tolerance of 0.07 Da, MS/MS tolerance at 40 ppm and requiring strict tryptic specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C in TBS/0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin. For breast cancer, 86.6% of the 112 cases with adjacent normal tissues overexpress XPO6 by a median 1.36-fold (Figure 1B). Cells were permeabilized by PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, denatured by 2M HCl for 30 min and neutralized by 0.1M sodium tetraborate for 2 min. Data were analyzed by Python 3.8 for statistical significance with the Scipy, Pingouin, and Scikit Posthocs packages. Raw data had been processed through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) and provided as log2 transformed normalized values against a common pool of reference samples. For overall survival analysis of various TCGA datasets as undivided cohorts (Figures 1E and S6E) or stage-defined sub-cohorts (Figures 1F, 2A, and S6E), RNA-seq data and clinical information hosted by KM plotter were used. For all analyses, median cutoff was chosen to split cohorts evenly into subgroups with high versus low mRNA or protein levels of XPO6 and Pfn1. Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.6-p5. Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.6-p5. The TMM size factors and the matrix of counts were imported into the R/Bioconductor package Limma. These normalized data were loaded into the Integrated Genome Viewer (Robinson et al , 2011) and replicates for each sample were summed together. In the combined datasets, we observed nearly significant correlation (p = 0.066) between high XPO6 mRNA levels and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in lymph-node-positive, but not lymph-node-negative, patients (Figure S2E), and this was confirmed using an individual dataset (GSE21653) (Finetti et al , 2008) (Figure S2F). In addition, we observed statistically significant association between high XPO6 protein levels and worse OS of a cohort of 65 breast cancer patients (Tang et al , 2018)( Figure 1G), the only proteomic dataset available at KM Plotter for outcome analysis. XPO6 knockdown caused no growth inhibition of Pfn1-null chondrocytes infected with an empty vector or YFP (Figures 4C and 4D). Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. BOD1L1 is a limitedly characterized protein with a role in DNA replication fork stability (Higgs et al , 2015).
