The majority of blood specimens collected preconception were nonfasting in our study population (14.5% of women were fasting at the time of blood sample collection). The use of preconception fatty acids determined in plasma phospholipids among women who were attempting pregnancy enabled us to address a potential link between physiologic status of specific fatty acids and both pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing was performed on daily first-morning urine samples collected on the last 10 days of each womanâ€™s first and second cycles of study participation and on spot urine samples collected at all end-of-cycle visits. Height and weight were measured at baseline to calculate BMI (kg/m2). The imputed data sets were used during the multivariable analysis.We used log-binomial regression models to examine associations between plasma fatty acids and pregnancy, live birth, and pregnancy loss and estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Excluding the five plasma fatty acids with CVs >20% from the composite measures of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA did not alter the results for pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and live birth. We found that certain preconception plasma phospholipid fatty acids were associated with live birth among women who had experienced one or two previous pregnancy losses. Therefore, we investigated associations between preconception plasma fatty acid status and pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and live birth among women with prior pregnancy loss, a group that may be particularly amenable to potential lifestyle changes to improve their fertility. As plasma phospholipid fatty acid status is not entirely due to dietary intake, it is possible that our observations could have been in part due to confounding by complex metabolic pathways that lead to altered fatty acid metabolism and subsequently affect pregnancy outcomes.
