As an internal program review for performance improvement, the study was exempt from institutional review board (IRB) review. Central line blood stream infections are also a component of the Medicare hospital-acquired condition program; however, during data verification, an error was identified in how these data were extracted to the data warehouse and it had to be excluded from the analysis. In contrast, there were higher rates of dialysis, C-diff infection, MRSA bacteremia, and total ventilator hours. On the value-based outcomes, there is no longer a difference in readmission rates, while higher rates of dialysis, C-diff, MRSA, and ventilator hours persist. The key metrics will vary across international payment systems, but this study provides a roadmap for analyzing metrics once those key metrics are identified.
