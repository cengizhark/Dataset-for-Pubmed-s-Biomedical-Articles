From these staining patterns, we defined the desmin+ ALCAM+ cells associated with type IV collagen of the basal lamina as “submesothelial cells.” Near the liver surface, desmin+ ALCAM+ cells, not associated with the basal lamina, were also identified in the parenchyma a short distance (3–5 hepatoblast layers) away from the submesothelial cells (Fig. From these expression patterns and location, we classified three populations of mesenchymal cells in developing liver: HSCs in the liver parenchyma (desmin+ p75NTR+ αSMA+/−), submesothelial cells beneath the mesothelium (desmin+ p75NTR+ ALCAM+ PDGFRα+), and perivascular mesenchymal cells in the vicinity of the vessels (desmin+ p75NTR+ α-SMA+) (Fig. These staining data indicate that submesothelial cell are actively dividing in the fetal livers as compared with mesothelial cells and transitional cells. X-gal Staining and Fluorescence ImmunohistochemistryWhole embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% X-gal solution at 37°C for 4 hours.13 For detection of lacZ activities in sections, frozen sections (7 µm) were incubated in X-gal solution as above and counter-stained with eosin Y (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).For immunostaining, cryosections were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Quantitative PCR showed that high expression levels of α-Sma, desmin, podoplanin, and β-actin were maintained in 8-day culture (Fig. Immunofluorescence staining showed that desmin+ HSCs, α-SMA+ perivascular mesenchymal cells, and ALCAM+ submesothelial cells expressed lacZ (Fig. The primary antibodies used in immunostaining are listed in Table 1. Based on the immunostaining with antibodies against these and other known markers and location, we defined at least three different populations of liver mesenchymal cells: HSCs (desmin+ p75NTR+ αSMA+/−), submesothelial cells (desmin+ p75NTR+ ALCAM+-PDGFRα+), and perivascular mesenchymal cells (desmin+ p75NTR+ αSMA+) (Fig. We also found that ALCAMhigh cells isolated from developing livers highly express Hgf and pleiotrophin, the two important mitogens for hepatocytes.23 Therefore, our findings are consistent with the proposal that submesothelial cells support hepatoblast proliferation in developing liver. Using MesP1-Cre and R26R mice, we presented the evidence that the three distinct populations of fetal liver mesenchymal cells shown in this study are derived from lateral plate mesoderm. In summary, this study has identified three populations of fetal liver mesenchymal cells that can all be traced to the MesP1-expressing mesoderm lineage. Complementary DNAs were synthesized from 30 ng total RNAs using SuperScript III and Oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen). Then, 3.75 µg from each cDNA was fragmented and labeled with Biotin using FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin module V2 (NuGen). Confirmation of the microarray results by qPCR analysis was performed for some of these genes (Fig.
