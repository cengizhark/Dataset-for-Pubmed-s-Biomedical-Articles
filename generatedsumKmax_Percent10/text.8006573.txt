However, we excluded from enrollment in this study any participants who had significant histories of psychological conditions and/or treatments and therefore the present sample may underestimate distress in this population. Further sophistication in cognitive assessment may be brought about by the utilization of machine learning techniques to allow the quantification of natural language to identify cognitive functioning and deficits. Given the discordance between objective and subjective cognitive measures, it is likely that different neural phenotypes underlie subjective and objective cognitive function, and therefore separate models are required to predict self-reported cognitive functioning. Patients included 42 who were scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy and 34 who were not scheduled for chemotherapy. The Stanford University Institutional Review Board approved this study and all participants provided written informed consent (IRB #14623). Resting State fMRI Acquisition and PreprocessingRsfMRI data were acquired with a GE Discovery MR750 3.0 Tesla whole body scanner (GE Medical Systems) on the same day as the PRO-Cog questionnaires (see Supplemental Methods for further details). Data points missing due to participant attrition were handled assuming that data were missing at random. We evaluated four different regression models: linear regression according the general linear model, support vector machine regression (SVR) (Cortes and Vapnik 1995) (C = 1) with a linear kernel, SVR with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and random forest (RF) regression (Breiman 2001) (trees = 500, mtry = 3).Cross-validation results in a different model fit within each fold and thus it is not possible to determine precisely the coefficients or significance values for the features. The best performing models accounted for 46% of the variance in executive function and 19% of the variance in memory function. However, all of the connectome models performed quite similarly, and it is unlikely that they are significantly different from each other.
