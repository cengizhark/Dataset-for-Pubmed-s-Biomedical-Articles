Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaWe carried out a literature search in MEDLINE (via PubMed), SciELO and LILACS using the terms norovirus* OR calicivirus* AND “country.” We carried out the search individually for each Latin American country following the list of Pan American Health Organization membership nations.14 There were no language limitations or other filters applied to the search. This could have overestimated the prevalence of norovirus infection among AGE cases if winter months were over-represented, although we think this is unlikely since only 8 out of the 29 studies included had recruitments that were not multiples of 12 months. Prevalence of Norovirus Infection Among Asymptomatic SubjectsWe found 13 studies providing data on the prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection from 6 countries, with data collected between 1989 and 2012. The overall prevalence of norovirus infection among AGE cases in Latin America is in line with a recent global systematic review and meta-analysis of noroviruses, which found noroviruses to be associated with 18% of AGE cases.3 While the general design of our review is similar to the one by Ahmed et al,3 there are some important differences: we did not stratify per development index or strain year, and the scope of our review is wider, including not only the prevalence of norovirus but also incidence, seroepidemiology and outbreaks.
