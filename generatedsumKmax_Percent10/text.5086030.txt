Although there is evidence that those with BNhxAN have MMPI profiles almost completely in the pathological range, in particular, exhibiting more obsessive-compulsiveness and impulsivity than those with BN and no history of AN,20 these groups generally have not differed in personality disorder diagnoses.5,21 From a less pathological perspective, no differences were found in impulsivity using the impulse regulation subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory22 (EDI).5 Similarly, research with the perfectionism subscale of the EDI22,23 has yielded no group differences.5,17,18 Thus, most of the evidence suggests no significant differences between these groups in terms of perfectionism and impulsivity. Interested, eligible participants were then scheduled to attend an in-person assessment where they gave written informed consent and completed a set of questionnaires privately. Recent work on childhood trauma and eating pathology suggests that maltreatment may be associated with certain aspects of bulimic pathology.43 These authors found that vomiting and laxative abuse were associated with sexual abuse and that emotional abuse was associated with eating pathology severity among women with BN; however, they did not report data related to a history of AN. First, the measures used are some of the most well-established and commonly used assessments reflecting the current understanding of eating pathology, personality, and childhood maltreatment. Also, rather than focus on one type of maltreatment, we used a measure that provided a range of various forms of abuse and neglect, which has long been advocated by trauma researchers.47 Second, the entire sample met criteria for a diagnosis of BN as established by a valid semistructured interview. Although the CTQ is a well-established, psychometrically sound measure, it does not include the age(s) at which the maltreatment occurred, which may be relevant to better understanding connections with eating pathology.
