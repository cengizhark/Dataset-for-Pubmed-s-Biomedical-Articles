Various inflammatory stimuli can trigger the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex which consists of a regulatory subunit (IKKγ) and two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) (4). Importantly, we did not observe complete GSK-3 knock-down until 72 and 96 hours post siRNA transfection (Supplemental Fig. An increase in caspase-3 cleavage following 30μM pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibition was observed over 24 and 48 hours in Panc-1 (Fig. The efficiency of GSK-3 inhibition was indicated by the reduced basal phosphorylation of a GSK-3 substrate, glycogen synthase at serine 461 (Fig. Constitutive NF-κB activity in pancreatic cancer cells is IKK-dependentIn addition to the studies shown above relative to GSK-3, studies have also shown IKK to be essential in regulating constitutive NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells (8–10). However, the suppressive effect of IKKα and combined IKKα/β knock-down were stronger than IKKβ knock-down alone (Fig. Importantly, we show that complete knock-down of GSK-3 and significant growth suppression was not observed until later time-points post siRNA transfection (Supplemental Fig. IKKα clone 14A231 and IKKβ clone10AG2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Small RNA interferenceThe following siRNA (siGenome SMARTpool) was obtained from Dharmacon (Layfayette, CO) as a pool of four annealed double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides: IKKα (M-003473-02), IKKβ (M-003503-03), GSK-3α (M-003009-01), GSK-3β (M-003010-03), and non-targeting control #3 (D001201-03). Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Layfayette, CO) was used to transfect 100nM siRNA according to manufacturer’s instruction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and NF-κB DNA binding ELISAEMSA and NF-κB super-shift analysis was performed on nuclear extracts as previously described (20) using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to an NF-κB site within the MHC class I promoter region. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as previously described (23). Protein extracts were quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (20). Protein extracts were quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (20). Relative light units were measured on an Lmax Microplate Luminometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized to pRL-TK Renilla luciferase light units. Real-time PCR was performed and analyzed as previously described (20) using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primer-probe sets (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for IκBα (Hs00153283_m1) and Bcl-xL (Hs00236329_m1). Relative light units were measured on an Lmax Microplate Luminometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).
