Here, it is important to note that a 10-minute-long whole cell recording results in some run down of the NMDA-eEPSC independent of MK-801 treatment. First, we replicated the original observations in hippocampal slices (Hessler et al , 1993). We then rapidly removed MK-801 and measured the NMDA-eEPSC after 1 minute (Fig. We then rapidly removed MK-801 and measured the NMDA-eEPSC after 1 minute (Fig. Slice preparationTransverse hippocampal slices (400 μM) were prepared from 12- to 21- day old Sprague–Dawley rats and incubated in oxygenated solution containing in mM: 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 12 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-Glucose, 2 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2 at room temperature (24-27°C). Spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion is a salient feature of all synapses (Fatt and Katz, 1952; Del Castillo and Katz, 1954) including those in synaptic networks in vivo (Pare et al , 1997; Pare et al , 1998; Chadderton et al , 2004). This construct is better localized to synaptic vesicles and manifests minimal surface fluorescence compared to the classical synaptophluorin, which is a fusion construct of synaptobrevin (Zhu et al , Society for Neuroscience Abstract 2004; (Granseth et al , 2006)) (Fig. For these imaging experiments we selected isolated 1 μm2 fluorescent puncta, which typically correspond to individual synapses (Liu et al , 1999). Folimycin traps vesicles in an alkaline state after endocytosis and provides a cumulative measure of exocytosis (Ryan et al , 1997; Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001). During experiments, slices were submerged and extracellular solution was continuously exchanged with a flow rate of 1-3ml/min. All experiments were performed at room temperature. ElectrophysiologyIn dissociated cultures, cells with pyramidal morphology were whole cell voltage-clamped to -70 mV in a modified Tyrode’s solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 2 CaCl2 (pH 7.4, 310 mOsm). This estimate is in line with earlier work (Geppert et al , 1994; Murthy and Stevens, 1999; Sara et al , 2005) as well as our electrophysiological measurements in this study (Fig. Within the synaptic cleft we assumed a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 μm2/ms in accordance with several earlier estimates (Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998; Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003; Nielsen et al , 2004), whereas outside the cleft we assumed a diffusion coefficient of 0.75 μm2/ms. However, if these receptors respond to evoked release and typically manifest a low probability mode (such as the L-mode) as suggested by our experiments presented in Figure 7, and spontaneous release occurs in the vicinity of R16 (near the periphery of the PSD), then the receptors at the opposite corner of the PSD show a more than ~20-fold reduction in peak open probability compared to R16. However, the difference between the open probabilities of R16 and R6 decrease to ~1.9-fold if we follow the above assumption (and our results presented in figure 7) that R16 is M-mode and R6 is L-mode. However, continued stimulation in the presence of Sr2+ and MK-801 for 3 minutes resulted in substantial inhibition of NMDA-eEPSCs (Fig. Second, once the NMDA receptors that are activated by both evoked and spontaneous release were blocked, NMDA-mEPSCs showed significant recovery at rest without concomitant recovery of NMDA-eEPSCs. First, spontaneous and evoked fusion events may originate from different synapses thus they may not activate the same set of receptors (Townsend et al , 2003). This possibility is hard to ascertain in our measurements due to two major caveats of our optical analysis. Nevertheless, our optical analysis is consistent with an earlier study in the frog neuromuscular junction, which found that the level of spontaneous release is relatively uniform across active zones and the location of spontaneous release corresponded well with the sites of evoked release, although the propensity of evoked release varied widely among active zones (Zefirov et al , 1995). We think this last model brings together the “different synapses” and “ectopic release” models in one scheme that could account for our data as well as earlier observations (Townsend et al , 2003). Solutions were exchanged via a local multibarrel perfusion pipette with a common perfusion port placed within 0.5 mm of the cell under study. All statistical comparisons were performed with two-tailed unpaired t-test (except in cases where measurements were paired e.g. The geometry is described by a 3-dimensional matrix S = (Si,j,k), Si,j,k = 1 if the element is inside the domain of diffusion, Si,j,k = 0 if the element is outside of the domain i.e., in non-diffusible domain.The standard thermo-diffusion equation is applicable for the glutamate concentration Ci,j,k = C(xi,yj,zk,t):(1)∂C∂t=Dglut(Cxx+Cyy+Czz);where the diffusion constant Dglut takes the value 0.4 μm2/ms inside the cleft and 0.75 μm2/ms outside the cleft. The geometry is described by a 3-dimensional matrix S = (Si,j,k), Si,j,k = 1 if the element is inside the domain of diffusion, Si,j,k = 0 if the element is outside of the domain i.e., in non-diffusible domain.The standard thermo-diffusion equation is applicable for the glutamate concentration Ci,j,k = C(xi,yj,zk,t):(1)∂C∂t=Dglut(Cxx+Cyy+Czz);where the diffusion constant Dglut takes the value 0.4 μm2/ms inside the cleft and 0.75 μm2/ms outside the cleft.

The space step and time step are chosen to ensure that the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL condition) (Courant et al  1927; LeVeque 2007) is satisfied and the explicit finite difference scheme will be numerically stable. For L-mode kinetics, the equations are similar except for the reaction rate constants were chosen according to the following kinetic scheme:(L­modeNMDAreceptor)CU⇔6034[C]CM⇔12017[C]C1⇔161127C2⇔2610580C3⇔21672508O1⇔6623449O2. This conclusion is also supported by several earlier studies that examined the properties of NMDA-mEPSCs in comparison to AMPA-mEPSCs (Umemiya et al , 1999; Groc et al , 2002; Dalby and Mody, 2003).
