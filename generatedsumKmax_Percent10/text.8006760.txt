Focal brain lesions may trigger structural and functional changes in perilesional and remote brain regions.1 Functional neuroimaging studies showed that neural activity in ipsilesional and contralesional cortical areas was pathologically increased when stroke patients moved their paretic hand,2 and that overactivity usually decreases over time, concomitant to clinical recovery.2,3 Modulation of cortical networks by pharmacological means or by noninvasive brain stimulation was demonstrated to ameliorate stroke-induced deficits.4-7 For example, the enhancement of monoaminergic influences via amphetamine in combination with physical therapy facilitates functional improvements after focal brain injury in rats, monkeys, and humans.8-11 Data are, however, inconclusive, as several clinical trials could not confirm positive effects of amphetamine for motor recovery in humans.12,13 The beneficial effects of amphetamine for the facilitation of motor recovery may result, at least in part, from interactions with the noradrenergic system.14-16 Recent studies in healthy humans revealed that modulating the noradrenergic system with reboxetine (RBX), a selective noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor,17 increases motor cortex excitability and improves motor learning as well as the performance in complex visuomotor tasks.18,19 Likewise, motor performance of stroke patients may be improved via noradrenergic stimulation with RBX.20 The neural mechanisms underlying such NA-mediated motor improvements, however, remain to be elucidated. It is important to note, however, that the RBX-improved motor performance of stroke patients observed in the current and a previous study represents a short-term effect.20 In animals, repeated administration of RBX induced a stronger increase in extracellular NA than a single dose of reboxetine did,72 and also increased the affinity of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.73 In addition, repeated administration of the alpha-1 receptor agonist methoxamine increased the density of cortical synapses.74 These long-term administration-induced adaptive changes in the noradrenergic system might consolidate the behavioral improvements induced by a single dose of stimulation and thereby induce long-lasting functional improvements. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was applied to fMRI data of key motor areas to assess the effects of RBX on interregional connectivity within the cortical motor system.23 We hypothesized that RBX-mediated improvements of motor performance in stroke patients might result from a normalization of abnormally increased neural activity in both hemispheres,3,4 which might be caused by enhanced coupling of neural activity between motor areas mediated by noradrenergic stimulation.24,25 They were subsequently normalized to MNI space using the SPM software by applying the deformation parameters derived from the respective T1 images.
