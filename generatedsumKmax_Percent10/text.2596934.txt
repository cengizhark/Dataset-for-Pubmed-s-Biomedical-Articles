The full-length TβRII promoter construct, pTβRII(−1670/+38)-luc, although less active, was almost completely (> 90%) suppressed by DHT under the same conditions in DU145 + AR cells (Supplementary Fig. Sp3 binds to the same Sp1 response elements, but may either activate or repress transcription, depending of context of other response elements or transcription regulators. Androgen-stimulated AR significantly diminished DNA binding to WT but not mutant Sp1-oligonucleotide (Supplementary Fig. MaterialsSources were: Recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); PNGase F (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA); pGL3-basic-luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI); Sp1 consensus (sc-2502) and mutant (sc-2503) oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); characterized Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and dextran-charcoal stripped FBS (DC) (HyClone, Logan, UT); CellTiter 96® Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI); Western blot antibodies- see supplemental material. This mechanism is likely to function cooperatively with another mechanism we previously described (11), involving the direct binding of active Smad3 to AR which blocks the interaction of Smad3 with SBE on target genes. Regardless of the specific mechanisms involved, loss of growth suppression/apoptosis by TGF-β is likely to enhance tumor growth. Thus, restoring TGF-β responses in androgen-independent epithelial cells, perhaps by intercepting the ability of AR to disrupt TGF-β signaling, is likely to have important therapeutic implications. Unless indicated, all experiments in NRP-154 and NRP-152 cells, were performed in 1% DC-GM3 medium, and experiments involving DU145, LNCaP, C4-2B, and VCaP cells, were performed in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% or 10% DC-stripped FBS and 15 mM HEPES. Cells were then washed twice with 1X PBS and dye was eluted by adding 1% Triton/PBS. Taq Polymerase Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for PCR amplification of rat TβRII, using 32 or 28 cycles, respectively, of the following temperature gradients: 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 2 min. DNA was purified and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected using TACS apoptosis DNA ladder kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was purified and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected using TACS apoptosis DNA ladder kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For each reaction, 1.5 μg of dimer was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 50 μl of Dynabeads® M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) washed twice with 2 X B&W buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl). Fourty-eight h of TGF-β1 treatment killed essentially all cells infected with the control or AR virus, whereas treatment with 1 or 10 nM DHT significantly protected AR expressing cells against killing by TGF-β1 (Fig. We next tested the possibility that androgen treatment can reverse the ability of TGF-β1 to reduce cyclin D expression. DHT downregulates expression of TβRII, but not TβRIWe previously reported that androgens disrupt the binding of Smad3 to SBE through a direct association of AR with Smad3 (11).
