Determining the origin and biology of BCSCs is important for the development of therapies to reduce the risk of breast cancer relapse. Since human BCSCs are resistant to ionizing radiation (18), we evaluated this and expression of double-stranded DNA repair pathway components (i.e. Ck5 and Ck14 are expressed by the basal layer and Ck8 and Ck18 by the luminal layer (21, 22). Other frequently cited markers of luminal (EpCAM, MUC1, galectin 3, claudin 4 and Ck18) and basal (CD10, osteonectin, S100, myosin light chain and integrin alpha 6) epithelial phenotypes were also assessed (Figures 5B–C). Of the luminal markers, EpCAM (p<0.0001) and claudin 4 (p<0.0001) were consistently downregulated in all M lines relative to the E lines and MUC1 was not expressed by any line. These observations are that (1) EMT was induced in vivo by CD8 T cells, (2) EMT generates mesenchymal tumor cells with BCSC properties, and (3) EMT (and BCSC genesis) is not associated with complete loss of epithelial characteristics. Our conclusion that the tumor cells had undergone EMT was based on a number of molecular and cellular changes including (1) loss of the epithelial markers CD24, E-cadherin, and claudin 3, (2) gain of validated mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Snail, (3) gain of matrix metalloproteinase activity, and (4) acquisition of a scattered phenotype. This risk, which remains high for at least one decade, suggests that treated patients still maintain a small population of tumorigenic, albeit dormant, cancer stem cells. Anti-CD3/CD28 received 400,000 mouse Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per well (~1 bead/5 T cells). Flow cytometry reagentsAntibodies and reagents from BD Pharmigen (San Diego, CA) included anti-CD24 FITC (M1/9), anti-CD44 FITC, PE-Cy5 (IM7), anti-Sca1 FITC (D7), anti-Annexin V APC and 7-AAD. The mouse monoclonal antibody against rat neu (7.16.4) was previously described (6). Anti-mouse IgG2a/2b FITC (R2–40) was from BD Pharmigen. Anti-mouse IgG2a/2b FITC (R2–40) was from BD Pharmigen. In vitro coculture of E cells with primed CD8sFVB mice were injected with 5 million E tumor cells and spleens removed 7 days later to isolate primed CD8 T cells as described above. Samples were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, imaged on a Gel Doc XR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and band intensities quantified with Quantity One software (ver. Eighty to 150 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes which were blocked for 1 hour with skim milk (3% w/v of PBS with Tween 20: PBS-T) and incubated overnight (4°C) with monoclonal antibodies against BCRP (BXP-21) or PGP (C219) from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ) diluted 1:50 and 1:500, respectively. Anti-β-actin was employed as loading control (AC-74, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cell lines were exposed to increasing concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μM) of mitoxantrone (diluted in 95% ethanol) for 72 hours. The following day plate optical densities were measured at 562 nm in an ELISA SpectraMax 190 reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California). Percent inhibition of growth was measured as a percent of control (no mitoxantrone).
