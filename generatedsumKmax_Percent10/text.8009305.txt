In MsFLASH 04, CBT-I ISI scores dropped nearly ten points, but the between-group difference was 5.2 points, which although statistically significant, doesn’t reach the 6-point threshold.18 Similarly, PSQI scores dropped four points in CBT-I, but the between-group difference was 2.7, just below the 3-point threshold.19Vaginal symptomsBothersome vaginal symptoms are observed in 40–70% of midlife women and are particularly bothersome in late menopause.5 The primary outcome of our fifth RCT was bothersome vaginal symptoms; we evaluated an FDA-approved 10 mcg vaginal estradiol tablet and an OTC vaginal moisturizer, compared to placebo tablet and gel.The MsFLASH Vaginal Health Trial did not find significant benefit from use of a 10 mcg vaginal estradiol tablet or a vaginal moisturizer compared to placebo tablet and gel in diminishing the severity of vaginal symptoms (Figure 3).5 In women who reported moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal itching, dryness, irritation or pain with sexual activity at baseline, all treatment groups had similar mean reductions in the severity of their most bothersome symptom (scale 0–3) over twelve weeks: estradiol −1.4 (95% CI: −1.6, −1.2), moisturizer −1.2 (95% CI: −1.4, −1.0), and placebo −1.3 (95% CI: −1.5, −1.1; P=0.25 estradiol vs. placebo, P=0.31 moisturizer vs. placebo). There was no overall benefit or harm of treatment with escitalopram, venlafaxine, oral or vaginal estradiol on sexual function (total Female Sexual Functioning Index, FSFI), but minor effects on FSFI domains should be mentioned. Hot flash interference,4 sleep quality, insomnia symptoms,16 and quality of life24 improved, and overall sexual function did not change.22 For escitalopram vs. placebo, the mean difference in hot flash frequency reduction was 1.41 (95% CI: 0.13, 2.69; P<0.001) fewer hot flashes per day.8Exercise (individual, facility-based aerobic training three times/week for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, but did modestly improve sleep quality compared to usual activity control.11 The intervention did not measurably affect quality of life.25Yoga (weekly 90-minute classes and 20-minute daily home practices four times per week for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, but did slightly improve quality of life and reduce insomnia symptoms9, 25 compared to usual activity control.Omega-3 supplement (1.8 gm daily for twelve weeks) did not significantly reduce the frequency, bother, or interference of hot flashes, nor did it improve sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, quality of life, or mood, compared to placebo.10, 25Venlafaxine XR (75 mg daily for eight weeks) had similar effects to Oral Estradiol (0.5 mg) on VMS frequency, an approximate 50% decrease from baseline compared to placebo.4 Venlafaxine XR improved insomnia symptoms and low-dose oral estradiol improved sleep quality, compared to placebo.17 Both venlafaxine and low-dose estradiol modestly improved hot flash interference4 and quality of life.26 There was no change in overall sexual function with either venlafaxine or low-dose oral estradiol, relative to placebo, although venlafaxine decreased sexual pain but resulted in diminished orgasm, and low-dose oral estradiol improved desire.23 For venlafaxine vs. placebo, the mean difference in hot flash frequency reduction was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.7; P=0.005) fewer hot flashes per day.
