In this series we used low stimulation intensities (0.05–0.3 mA) because we wanted to concentrate on modulation by quinpirole. Following dye loading, cortical re-stimulation resulted in exocytosis of FM1-43 dye from the terminals, which decreased in a manner approximated by a single exponent, characteristic of synaptic vesicle fusion (Figs. At this stimulation frequency, the mean halftime of release from corticostriatal terminals in slices from YAC128 mice was 17% lower at 1 month of age compared to WT (t1/2= 180 sec for YAC128 vs. t1/2= 211 sec for WT; Figs. By 12 months, corticostriatal halftimes of release in slices from YAC128 mice significantly increased by 28% (t1/2= 300 sec for YAC128 vs. t1/2= 234 sec for WT; Figs. AnimalsMice were obtained from the University of British Columbia or from the breeding colony at UCLA. In contrast, peak amplitudes of cells from YAC128 mice increased by 15.8±6.7% (p=0.0012 compared to values from WTs) and 6.5±11.6% (p=0.016 compared to values from WTs) at quinpirole concentrations of 1 and 10 μM, respectively.Although both amphetamine and quinpirole continued to inhibit release in older WT and YAC128 mice, corticostriatal filtering became impaired and the average response to D2 receptor manipulation declined with age. While dopamine’s inhibition of corticostriatal release decreased in both WT and YAC128 slices, there was a greater reduction in YAC128 mice by 12 months (Fig. Biphasic alterations in biophysical membrane properties and postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated currentsIn order to more specifically examine postsynaptic changes in AMPAR function, we assessed changes in evoked currents in acutely dissociated MSNs at 1 and 7 months. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. This age-related effect led to a significant difference in response size when the comparisons were made at 7 months. At 12 months, the synaptic response amplitude in YAC128 MSNs remained depressed. Brains were dissected and sliced in the coronal plane (350 μm thick) in oxygenated ice-cold low-Ca2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 glucose. Since the faster releasing terminals would induce larger amplitude postsynaptic currents (Bamford et al , 2004b) in D2-presenting MSNs (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007), persistence of these amplified responses into adulthood would provoke excitatory stress on D2-positive neurons with preferential degeneration of MSNs projecting to the globus pallidus (Reiner et al , 1988; Albin et al , 1990). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier in concert with Clampex acquisition software (v8.1). Passive membrane properties of MSNs were determined in voltage clamp mode by applying a depolarizing step voltage command (10 mV) and using the membrane test function integrated in the pClamp8 software. The patch pipette (4–5 MΩ) contained the following solution (in mM): 130 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 0.5 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, 0.1 leupeptin and 4 QX-314 (pH 7.25–7.3, 280–290 mOsm). Evoked AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV in ACSF containing 10 μM bicuculline (BIC, a GABAA receptor antagonist). Coronal sections (200 μm thick) containing cortex and striatum were cut on a vibratome and allowed to recover for 1 h in carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ACSF solution: (in mM) 109 NaCl, 5 KCl, 35 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaHPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES acid and 10 glucose at room temperature. To stimulate dopamine release, bipolar electrodes were placed in the striatum and visualized on the edge of the region of interest (Fig. For whole cell voltage clamp recordings, the internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 175 N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 40 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 10 ethylene glycol-bis (-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 12 phosphocreatine, 2 Na2ATP, 0.2 Na2GTP, and 0.1 leupeptin (pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mOsm, Sigma Chemicals). The Mg2+-free external solution consisted of (in mM) 135 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 3 BaCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 0.02 glycine, and 0.0003 tetrodotoxin (TTX, pH 7.4, 300–310 mOsm, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The Mg2+-free external solution consisted of (in mM) 135 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 3 BaCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 0.02 glycine, and 0.0003 tetrodotoxin (TTX, pH 7.4, 300–310 mOsm, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Solution changes were performed by changing the position of the array with a DC drive system controlled by a SF-77B perfusion system (Warner Instruments) synchronized by pClamp. Responsiveness of cells to AMPA application in the absence or presence of 10 μM cyclothiazide (CTZ) was examined at a holding potential of −70 mV. Analyses were performed with Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), Statistica 6.1 (Tulsa, OK), SigmaStat (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software suites. Group means for all measures were compared using Student’s t tests (for two group comparisons) and appropriately designed ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni t-tests (multiple group comparisons). At 1 month, the mean peak response amplitudes were significantly greater in cells from YAC128 mice compared to those of WTs at stimulation intensities between 0.3–1.0 mA (Figs.
