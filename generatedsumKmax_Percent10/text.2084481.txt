The original dataset was divided into two halves, each containing three blocks of trials (near, middle, and far, in counterbalanced order), and the median RT, percentage errors, and IE scores were analysed with a mixed ANOVA as before, except now including the variable experiment half (first half, second half). Importantly, there were no significant interactions with the variable congruency - no changes in the magnitude or spatial distribution of multisensory interactions across the two halves of the experiment.The temporal modulations of the crossmodal congruency effects support the ‘general movement preparation’ hypothesis, and contradict both the ‘long-lasting modulation hypothesis’, and the ‘spatially-specific movement preparation hypothesis’.Following the suggestion of one of our reviewers, we also performed an additional experiment in which twenty-four new naïve participants directed a laser pointer at the distant tool use target (which was replaced with a 5mm diameter laser-detecting diode). Temporal modulation of the crossmodal congruency effectThe data reported here show a clear effect of tool use movement preparation (i.e., the interaction between congruency and trial order) on the magnitude of multisensory interactions measured along two hand-held tools. Conversely, in the random tool use group, crossmodal congruency effects on the first trial after tool use were nearly ten times higher than on the same trial in the regular tool use group (88ms), while the second to fourth trials in this group showed effects similar to those of the regular tool use group. This hypothesis also predicted that crossmodal congruency effects in the random tool use group would remain high and relatively constant across trial order, since the ‘Go’ cue for the tool use task could have been presented at any time after the preceding tool use trial. They showed that repeatedly crossing two tools in opposite directions over the midline (i.e., a different tool use task to the one used here), led to a significant change in spatial modulations following active tool use, specifically in the last four blocks of trials, as compared to the first four blocks.The relevant behavioural cue informing the participants to begin the tool and laser use tasks was an additional visual target stimulus (an LED) placed 100cm away from the hands, and 67cm above the table surface (60cm above the tools). Furthermore, while the laser use experiment resulted in similar temporal effects as those found in the regular tool use experiment (a linear increase across trial order), very different spatial effects emerged (i.e., no significant effect of side in the middles or at the tips of the tools). However, it is not yet clear whether these different experimental approaches are equally applicable to understanding multisensory peripersonal space, or whether instead the choice of experimental design may affect the particular results obtained. Our series of tool use experiments have mostly followed what we term the ‘interleaved’ design of tool use experiments - individual tool use movement trials are interleaved with trials of the task used to measure peripersonal space (i.e., the crossmodal congruency task used in the present manuscript, and Holmes et al  2004; Maravita et al  2002b; see also Holmes et al  2007, for different designs). These diverse results suggest that it is not yet clear to what extent the reported multisensory effects of tool use are solely due to neural representations of hand-centred peripersonal space per se, or alternatively are due, at least in part, to shifts or biases in visual or multisensory spatial attention (see Holmes et al  2007, for five experiments investigating this point in more detail). In order to assess the possible effects of covert (and uninstructed) tool use movement preparation on multisensory interactions in peripersonal space, we therefore manipulated the temporal and spatial predictability of the required tool use task and analysed crossmodal congruency effects on a trial-by-trial basis. If tool use movement preparation affects the magnitude or spatial distribution of crossmodal congruency effects, however, then one would expect to find significant effects of trial order and significant differences between the two groups of participants. By contrast, the regular tool use group should show maximal peripersonal space-like effects on trials immediately preceding a tool use movement - a significant interaction between the spatial and temporal experimental variables. Furthermore, this interaction between trial order and congruency differed significantly between the two groups, F(3,171)=2.72, p<.05 (see Figure 3).
