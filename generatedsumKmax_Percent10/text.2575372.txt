IPSCs elicited by CPPG (ON) or kainate (OFF) stimulation were reduced to similar extents by CPP (10 μm) and abolished by the additional application of GYKI (25 μM; Figure 5E–G). Similar results were observed in mouse (ω-conotoxin GVIA and isradipine reduced IPSCs to 44 ± 10% of control, n = 5, p = 0.0002). Conversely, in the presence of the NMDAR antagonist CPP (10 μm), RR reduced IPSCs significantly (to 70 ± 15% of CPP alone, n = 6, p = 0.002; Figure 7D, H) but 2-APB did not (93 ± 7% of CPP alone, n = 6, p = 0.08; Figure 7F, H). Under these conditions, IPSCs were reduced by the group I mGluR antagonist LY367385 (50 μM; Figure 8A, E). Neither the Group II mGluR antagonist LY341495 (5 μM; Figure 8C, E) nor the Group III antagonist MSOP (100 μM; Figure 8 D, E) reduced IPSCs significantly. LY367385 (50 μm) exerted insignificant effects on IPSCs evoked by puffs of CPPG (97 ± 5% of control, n = 4, p = 0.31; Supplementary Figure 3A, D) or kainate (92 ± 9% of control, n = 4, p = 0.18; Supplementary Figure 3B, D). AIIs, stimulated by glutamate or synaptic input from RBCs, could contribute indirectly to glycinergic feedback via Cx36 gap junctions to ON cone bipolar cells (Mills et al , 2001) that, in turn, excite other ON glycinergic amacrine cells that contact RBCs. CICR is observed in many neuronal types and usually is mediated by IP3Rs and/or RyRs (Berridge, 1998). 2Diffusion of exogenous agents puff in the OPL and IPL. 2Diffusion of exogenous agents puff in the OPL and IPL. In many experiments (n = 173), recordings were made with Alexa-488 hydrazide (50 μM) added to the patch solution (Figure 1A), allowing morphology to be confirmed at the end of the experiment. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Axoclamp-1D, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) were made while continuously superfusing the slice with ASCF in a rate of 1–2 ml/min. All experiments, except where indicated, were performed at room temperature in ACSF supplemented with the specific GABAA and GABAC receptor antagonists, SR95531 (10 μM) and 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-methylphosphonic acid (TPMPA; 50 μM), respectively. The tip of the puffer pipette was positioned at various locations within the xy plane of the slice, according to the requirements of the particular experiment; in the z-axis, it was positioned just beneath (≤ 20 μm) the surface of the slice. The puffing solution was identical to control ACSF, except that it contained the stimulating agent (e.g., glutamate, CPPG, kainate, or caffeine) and was pH-buffered with HEPES (10 mM). In some experiments (Figure 5), CPPG (600 μM, 300 ms, 1.5 bar) or kainate (100 μM, 300 ms, 1.5 bar) was puffed in the OPL (80–100 μm laterally from the recorded RBC) to activate ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. In these experiments, control ACSF also contained the group III mGluR agonist L-AP4 (10 μM). Following three responses at that position, the pipette was moved laterally in the IPL and three responses were recorded at each position. At the end of each series, the pipette was returned to the 0-μm position and three final responses were averaged and compared to the 0-μm responses obtained at the beginning of the experiment. Peak response amplitudes at each position were normalized to that recorded at the initial 0 μm position in control solution. The spatial extent of the puff itself (Supplementary Figure 1) was quantified in the same way to facilitate comparison with the glutamate-evoked IPSC data. Feedback IPSC amplitude was measured as the difference between the response peak and the baseline preceding stimulation. IPSCs were partially reduced by bath application of SR95531 (10 μM) and TPMPA (50 μM), GABAA and GABAC receptor antagonists, respectively(to 33 ± 10 % of control; n = 4; p = 0.006; Fig 1C, D). Furthermore, the reduction of the IPSC by TTX remained incomplete even in the presence of DHT (Figure 2C, D). Glutamate-evoked IPSCs were reduced by application of the non-NMDAR antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX, 25 μM; Figure 4A, E) or the NMDAR antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 μM; Fig 4B, E). Glutamate-evoked IPSCs also were reduced by the AMPAR-specific antagonist GYKI 53655 (50 μM; Figure 4C, E) but were only slightly affected by the Ca2+-permeable AMPAR antagonist philanthotoxin 433 (PhTx; 1 μM; Fig.
