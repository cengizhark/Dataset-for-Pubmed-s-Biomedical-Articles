CFD technique has been widely utilized in the past in field of Rhinology to simulate nasal airflow15–17, heat exchange18, aerosols19 and volatile chemical dispersion20–22, and this study represent the first attempt to extend CFD technique to the investigation of nasal irrigation. The nasal mucosal wall was assumed to be immobile and smooth. The nasal mucosal wall was assumed to be immobile and smooth. The advection scheme and turbulence Numerics were both set at “high resolution”. The simulation applied a transient scheme with second order backward Euler to capture the full fluid motion during the irrigation, with an initial time step set at 5e−6s and the adaptive time steps set based on the target optimal number of iteration loops (3–5), and minimum and maximum time step (1e−6s – 0.01s). The CFD model presented in this study provides a number of benefits over previously used methods to evaluate distribution of sinonasal irrigations. Draf II) may potentially prevent such adverse outcome, pending future studies with more cases and more validations.
