Reactive oxygen species are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and may arise from various sources such as mitochondrial electron transport, and oxidative enzymes.7 Reactive oxygen species are particularly important in innate immunity and are produced by activated neutrophils as defense mechanisms against extracellular pathogens. 13 Low-grade inflammation is established as a mechanism involved in the progression of cardiovascular disease through increased adhesion molecules and cytokine production.14 During inflammation, leukocyte numbers in the vascular wall greatly increases due to migration and proliferation.13 This leads to oxidative stress and increased inflammation, causing impaired vascular function.2 The inflammatory state leads to endothelial cell barrier dysfunction which results in increase vascular permeability.15 Hyperpermeability triggered by vascular and tissue inflammation or ischemia promotes edema, exacerbates disease progression, and impairs recovery.16 Development of atherosclerotic plaques is associated with immune cell invasion of vessel walls. To determine if increased IL-17 is pathophysiologically relevant in PE, Dhillon et al  examined the effect of IL-17 infusion on blood pressure via mediation by oxidative stress and production of the angiotensin II type I receptor autoantibody (AT1-AA).36 In this study, IL-17 infusion into normal pregnant rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), increased oxidative stress as measured by urinary isoprostane and NADPH-stimulated placental reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in the population of circulating TH17 cells, and production of AT1-AA. The only effective treatment for abatement of maternal symptoms is delivery of the placenta and fetus. In early pregnancy, the placenta is initially characterized as a hypoxic environment.
