Future studies will undoubtedly provide further evidence of conserved and differential mechanisms for axon and dendrite pruning in MB and ddaC neurons in Drosophila. Indeed, glial cells have been shown to engulf axonal debris [15, 16], dependent on the engulfment receptor Draper (Drpr, CED-1 homolog) [17, 18] and CED-6 [17]. Recently, two studies have highlighted astrocytes as the major phagocytic glia [19, 20] in a process that depends on Drpr [19, 20] functioning in parallel to CED-12 [19]. TGF-Î² signaling is initiated by glial secretion of Myo [21] functioning through the type I receptor Baboon (Babo) and either one of the type II receptors Punt or Wishful thinking (Wit) (Figure 3) [23]. Phagocytic hemocytes were shown to be involved engulfment and degradation of the dendritic fragments and debris [8], which involves activation of extracellular matrix metalloproteases [9]. Ubiquitin-proteasome system and its substrates during dendrite pruningThe UPS cell-autonomously regulates dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons [9], similar to MB axon pruning [14]. Moreover, DIAP1 and caspases are regulated by Valosin-containing protein (VCP) [46]. Inhibition of VCP causes the defects in ddaC dendrite pruning, occurring concomitantly with reduced caspase activity and high DIAP1 levels.Another E3 ligase that has recently been identified for its roles in both ddaC dendrite pruning and MB axon pruning is the Cullin1-based SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Figure 3) [28]. To achieve this, the F-box protein Slimb, a component of the SCF E3 ligase, associates with Akt, an activator of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway, resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [28].
