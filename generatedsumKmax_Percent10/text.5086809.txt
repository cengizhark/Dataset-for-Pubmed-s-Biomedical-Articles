The Z’factor is a standard statistical parameter used to evaluate the robustness of a high throughput assay (Zhang et al , 1999). We tested DMSO at a variety of concentrations and the results showed that the assay can tolerate DMSO up to 1 %. Using novel fatty acid amide ligands and detailed potency and efficacy analyses, we then demonstrated that degree of saturation in acyl chain and charged head groups of fatty acid amides have profound effects on the ability of fatty acid amides to activate G protein-coupled receptor 119. 384-well, round bottom, low volume white plates were purchased from Grenier Bio One (Monroe, NC). AR231453, Ro 20-1724 and palmitoyl ethanolamide were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Cell Transfection and CultureHuman Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Stably transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 800 µg/ml geneticin and maintained in growth medium containing 400 µg/ml of geneticin (G418) until needed for experiments. Data AnalysisData analyses were performed based on the ratio of fluorescence intensity of each well at 620 nm and 665 nm. The Z’ value was calculated using the formula: Z’ = 1–3[(standard deviation of negative control) + standard deviation of positive control)]/ [(mean of negative control) − (mean of positive control)] (Zhang et al , 1999). 1C and Table 1, all three previously reported G protein-coupled receptor 119 ligands, AR231453 (Semple et al , 2008), OEA (Overton et al , 2006), and PSN632408 (Overton et al , 2006), increased the cellular cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner, with a rank order of potency of AR231453 > OEA = PSN632408, and a rank order of efficacy of AR231453 = OEA > PSN632408. 3 and Table 3 demonstrate the agonist activity of different oleoyl amides as compared to OEA.
