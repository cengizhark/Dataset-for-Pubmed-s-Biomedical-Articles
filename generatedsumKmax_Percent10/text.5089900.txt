Criteria for inclusion for chart review were: age â‰¥ 18 years, an inpatient stay >1 calendar day, and a urine culture with >103 colony forming units. Medical record review was conducted by clinicians (physicians at 2 hospitals, pharmacists at one) using a standardized data abstraction tool and entered into an electronic database (REDCap version 5.6.0). Physician documentation was reviewed to assess for UTI symptoms (Table 1) and concurrent conditions that may contribute to symptoms. Antibiotic treatment both at day 1 and at day 4 after urine culture collection was assessed. An assessment of inter-rater reliability was performed at each hospital; 5% of data collected was reviewed by co-investigators experienced in medical record review, and overall agreement was 96%. The most frequent organism isolated from urine culture was Escherichia coli (n=119), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=36), Enterococcus spp. Of the 212 patients with ASB, and after excluding 48 patients on antibiotics for both UTI and non-UTI indications, the proportion of patients with ASB that received antibiotics for positive urine culture was 38% (62/164) at one day after urine culture collection. Dalen et al  observed ciprofloxacin to be the most common antibiotic used in 15 cases of overtreatment for ASB (33%), and Werner et al  identified that among all inpatient fluoroquinolone use, 30% was for ASB.11,22 Likewise, we observed broad-spectrum antibiotics comprise a substantial proportion of ASB treatment, thereby potentially contributing to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, and increased rates of C. difficile infection.8 The latter is of particular concern, given older age is an established risk factor for C. difficile infection, and our median patient age was 67 years.23 We did not observe a significant association between presence of multi-drug resistant urinary pathogens and risk for treatment of ASB, though we were underpowered to test this association.
