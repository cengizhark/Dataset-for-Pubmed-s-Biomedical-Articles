In mice, AA was also reported to be inhibited via blockade of CD44v10 (29), another immune cell skin-homing marker contributing to disease. Animals were housed 4–5 mice per cage in Allentown static cages on a 12:12-h light cycle with access to food (Purina LabDiet 5053) and reverse osmosis-filtered tap water, ad libitum. Timed matings were performed by placing 2–4 females in a single-housed male’s cage in the late afternoon and by checking for plugs early the next morning. Plugged females were group-housed 3–5 per cage until E12.5, when they were electroporated and single-housed. Plugged females were group-housed 3–5 per cage until E12.5, when they were electroporated and single-housed. The right hind leg was shaved, and 50 μl of DNA was injected into the middle of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Muscle cells expressed the transgenes, which in pCA-LacZ control mice could be visualized by staining for β-galactosidase activity in muscle fibres (Fig. In pCA-mIL6-electroporated mice, serum IL-6 rose to levels that peaked at 7 days postelectroporation, declining thereafter as plasmid DNA became inactivated (Fig. Mouse models, adoptive transfer experiments and human skin transplanted onto immunodeficient mice suggest that the disease is autoimmune mediated and that T cells play a significant role (3). However, the underlying immunological mechanisms, including the triggering events that lead to breaking tolerance, and subsequent events associated with spontaneous resolution of moderate lesions are incompletely understood. Immunofluorescence imaging of control skin from the pups of pCA-LacZ-transfected mothers revealed few CD3+ γδTCR- (presumed and later confirmed αβTCR+) cells, while CD3+ γδTCR+ dendritic epithelial T cells (DETC) were regularly spaced along the epithelial surface and lining the hair follicles (Fig. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of alopecia (F1,20 = 22.7, P < 0.0001) and a significant effect of cell type (F2,20 = 9.3, P = 0.0014).
