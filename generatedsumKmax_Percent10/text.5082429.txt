Social Attention as a Unitary ConstructIt is not by accident that social attention has been characterized in each of the functional categories discussed here. To examine this question will require systematic comparison of each functional category under both social and non-social contexts across development.If the social context does indeed support the development of social attention functions in unique ways, it may be that social attention functions discussed here are initially relatively distinct, but emerge as a unitary process during the course of typical developmental pathways. To identify whether these social attention functions—social visual attention, social motivation, social behavior—are unique (or convergent) developmental processes, this question should be directly examined by including multiple measures of each functional aspect.Aside from our understanding of the underlying structure of cognition and cognitive development, the existence of a dissociable mode of social attention would, in fact, have a number of important implications for our interpretation of research on attentional processes and their development. Other important potential implications relate to the development of intervention and treatment programs for such disorders. We have asked here whether current use of the term social attention is an independent construct (whether any forms of social attention can be differentiated from the same domain of activity in a non-social context) and if it reflects a unitary process (whether all forms of social attention are equal)—the answers to both of these questions are critical next steps to establish social attention as a useful construct. To place this increase in perspective, more than 50% of the articles considered here were published between 2010 and 2014.

These communicative actions begin early in the first months of life when an infant shares eye-to-eye gaze with a parent and ‘looks where someone else is looking’ (Butterworth & Jarrett, 1991; Scaife & Bruner, 1975). We consider these functions next. Social Attention as Social MotivationClinical research uses the term social attention broadly to characterize dysfunction in monitoring and decoding of social cues in a variety of clinical disorders, including individuals with anxiety disorders (Gardner, Pickett, Jefferis, & Knowles, 2005), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Stroes, Alberts, & Van Der Meere, 2003), schizophrenia (Nestor, Klein, Pomplun, Niznikiewicz, & McCarley, 2010), Williams Syndrome (Riby & Hancock, 2008), Cornelia-Lange Syndrome (Sarimski, 2007) and ASD. This group of studies highlights the need to for an empirical approach to determine the equivalence of social stimuli presented across studies (e.g., simple, static representations of social relevant stimuli compared to real-world, live social interaction; see also Risko et al ), as well as systematic examination of the role of context and the valence of the social signal itself.A limited number of studies have examined other components of basic visual attention (e.g., visual preference; decrement in looking) in the context of social events. Whether social attention in any of its functions and forms can be differentiated from other non-social domains of activity has been rarely examined in a direct way.One possibility would be that early in development, attention regulation capacity in the context of non-social and social events is isomorphic, but begins to diverge during the 8–12 month period, concurrent with the emergence of endogenous attention and executive function (resulting from brain maturation) along with cortical specialization for social stimuli, and ultimately becomes independent through the expression of social interaction behaviors (e.g., joint attention, nonverbal communication).
