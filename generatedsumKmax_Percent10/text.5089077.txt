This was the reason she had no residual stomach for use as the interposition, as would be the case for standard Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. At the current time, she had a total symptom score of 11 (range 0–20, none to worse), with a quality of life score of −3 (scale −3 to +3, worst to best). The esophagojejunal anastomosis was visualized at 25 cm from the incisors, and there was no evidence of stricture or recurrent tumor. Then, a temporary cardiac pacing lead (model 6414-200; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) was inserted through the accessory channel. This temporary lead has an inner bipolar pacing lead and an outer covering sheath. Similar health-related quality of life scores have been validated in previous studies.10 Further, the patient was able to tolerate a soft, low-residue diet very well during the 5-day period. Also, there is a likelihood of spectrum effect/bias in this patient with such severe symptoms; however, the improvement in her electrogastrogram parameters with electrical stimulation as well as the apparent improvement noted on the radionuclide emptying study probably indicates a true improvement secondary to electrical stimulation. Implanting permanent electrodes surgically in this patient would have required a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.
