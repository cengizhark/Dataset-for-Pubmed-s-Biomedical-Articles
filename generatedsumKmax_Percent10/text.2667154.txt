We then sought the time at which the two SDFs started to differentiate. For this purpose, we first searched for the time bin (bin width = 1 ms) where the difference in the two SDFs was maximum between the cue onset and the longest SRT in that session. Physiological evidence has yet to be provided at the single-cell level. We then sought the time at which the two ensemble average activities started to differentiate. This is likely because in both cases the monkey was primed for the stimulus that had been the target in the nonswitch trials. A plausible hypothesis is that the pre-SMA switch signal is implemented by the STN, through direct connections from the pre-SMA to the STN (Inase et al , 1999). Indeed, the STN has been suggested to play a role in the switching of movement (Monchi et al , 2006), yet the detailed underlying mechanism is unknown. Figure 3B illustrates the activity of the contra-switch neuron shown in Figure 3A but now as the animal performed the saccade Go/Nogo task. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia plays an important role in motor control. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia plays an important role in motor control. On the other hand, it could reflect a shift of attention or a direction-selective conflict between automatic and controlled saccades. The present study and our previous study (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007) show that both the STN and pre-SMA contain switch neurons. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the switch signal in the STN originates from the pre-SMA rather than the STN influencing the pre-SMA through output nuclei of the basal ganglia and the thalamus (Alexander et al , 1986). 6B), which roughly correspond to the pre-SMA projection area (Inase et al , 1999). 6B), which roughly correspond to the pre-SMA projection area (Inase et al , 1999). This conclusion resembles what has been shown by functional neuroimaging studies (Aron and Poldrack, 2006; Aron et al , 2007) but extends understanding of STN functions in several ways. Figure 7 illustrates hypothetical circuit diagrams that can account for the underlying neuronal pathways. Our data suggest that the switch signal in the pre-SMA is implemented by the STN, consistent with the idea that the cortico-subthalamic pathway is ideal for quick implementation of behavioral control requiring a cessation of ongoing movement. The STN is involved in two major streams in the basal ganglia        circuitry linking the frontal cortex to the thalamus and brainstem motor areas: the 'hyperdirect'        pathway (Cortex-STN-GPi/SNr) and the 'indirect' pathway (Cortex-Striatum-GPe-STN-GPi/SNr). Rastergrams and SDFs are aligned with cue onset. Data for the pre-SMA derived from our previous study (Isoda and        Hikosaka, 2007). Behavioral tasksDuring experimental sessions, the monkey was placed in a sound-attenuated room and seated in a primate chair with its head immobilized. Behavioral tasks were under control of a QNX-based real-time experimentation data acquisition system (REX; Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health (LSR/NEI/NIH), Bethesda, MD). In this task, a peripheral cue appeared transiently for 100 ms after the monkey had fixated on the FP for 800 ms. Following a short delay (200 ms for monkey T, 100 ms for monkey S), the white FP changed to one of the two stimulus colors as a cue. A reward was given after the monkey captured the target stimulus and maintained the fixation for another 300 ms. Recording proceduresEye movements were recorded with the use of the magnetic search-coil technique with temporal resolution of 1 ms (Robinson, 1963). The electrode was driven by a hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-97A; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) through a stainless steel guide tube, which was used to penetrate the dura and was held in place by a grid that was fixed inside the recording chamber (Crist et al , 1988). The head then was fixed to the stereotaxic device, and the brain was cut into blocks in the coronal plane parallel to the electrode penetrations. Frozen sections were cut every 50 Î¼m using a microtome and were stained for Nissl using thionin. These observations, together with the basal ganglia network models (DeLong, 1990; Mink, 1996; Nambu et al , 2002) (supplemental Fig. To determine the statistical significance of difference in the peak SDF values between Go and Nogo trials, we used a resampling procedure (n = 1,000) to estimate a 95% confidence interval of the activity difference (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).The behavioral differentiation time for the saccade Go/Nogo task was measured in an analogous manner to that in the saccade overriding task.
