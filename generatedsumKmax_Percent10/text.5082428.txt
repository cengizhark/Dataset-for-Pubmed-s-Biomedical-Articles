Considering all nonsense, frameshift and canonical splice-site mutations as truncating, we observed that CEP290, CSPP1 and C5ORF42 mostly harbor a combination of two truncating mutations, CC2D2A and TMEM67 tend to have â‰¥1 missense mutation, and TMEM216 and INPP5E have mainly two missense mutations. Even after Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, the associations between TMEM67 and liver disease and coloboma, and those between CEP290 and retinal dystrophy remained statistically significant (p<0.0001). Our findings validate prior results from smaller cohorts focused on single genes,[44,45,46] and also identify additional positive and negative correlations. Subject ascertainment and phenotypic dataParticipants were referred to the University of Washington (UW) Joubert Syndrome Research Program by the Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders Foundation and clinical collaborators internationally (see Acknowledgements). Joubert syndrome (JS, OMIM 213300) is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormal eye movements, respiratory control disturbances, cognitive impairment, hypotonia and ataxia. We used the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) algorithm to estimate the deleteriousness of variants (version 1.1),[37] and considered all nonsense, frameshift and canonical splice-site mutations to be deleterious, regardless of CADD score. The large size of the cohort and world-wide ascertainment based on brain imaging and neurologic findings provide a relatively unbiased spectrum of the disorder. Liver fibrosis and coloboma were strongly associated (Odds Ratio (O.R.) Liver fibrosis and coloboma were strongly associated (Odds Ratio (O.R.) Retinal dystrophy and kidney disease (O.R. 1.7-5.2), liver fibrosis and kidney disease (O.R. 1.6-5.5) and polydactyly and encephalocele (O.R. 1.6-5.5) and polydactyly and encephalocele (O.R. In addition, we observed multiple combinations of features in subsets of individuals, often precluding categorization into one of the proposed sub-types (Supplementary Table S3). This is likely an under-ascertainment compared to prior studies,[38] since detailed review of the brain imaging studies was not part of this study. Other, less common, features included scoliosis (n=28), cleft palate (n=20), hearing loss (n=16), tongue tumors (n=17), oral frenulae (n=9), heart defects (n=7), and a variety of mental health problems such as anxiety, aggression, depression and autism (total n=47). a homozygous frameshift mutation in C5ORF42 versus two missense variants in CSPP1, which harbors exclusively truncating mutations in our cohort).
