2A).10,11 The coin cell battery must be recharged after 19 hours of use, with approximately 30 minutes required for each charging cycle, and can sustain 100 recharging cycles (about 3 months of operation). The FAR during stimulation was 25.955 bpm/mV but increased to 42.657 bpm/mV when the stimulation was turned OFF and the second baseline reading was recorded. 5B) and was well secured by the use of endoclips, wire electrodes pinned into the mucosa, and “ears” clipped into place. We were able to modulate the myoelectric activities of the porcine stomach with this endoscopically implanted stimulator. In the Baseline-2 recording, a significant increase in FAR (by 16.702 bpm/mV) was noted, as compared with the FAR during stimulation. Wireless GES deviceOur prototype wirelessly rechargeable stimulator measures 35 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm (Fig.
