It should be pointed out, however, that in its present form the method does not distinguish between a 3β-hydroxy-5-ene sterol and its corresponding 3-oxo-4-ene analogue. A single passage of cholesterol through the Unisil column results in 95% elution in fraction 1, and 5% elution in fraction 2 (see Supplementary Fig. Following treatment of fraction 2 with cholesterol oxidase and derivatisation with GP, desmosterol (m/z 516.3948) was found at 0.5 - 1.5% of the level of cholesterol (relative abundance, RA, 100%, m/z 518.4105) in fraction 2. Minor components with m/z 550.4003 were observed (RA 1%, 2%), both of which gave MS2 or MS3 spectra compatible with dihydroxycholesterols with at least one of the added hydroxyl groups in the A or B ring. Oxysterol analysis by electrospray (ES) suffers from their poor ionisation cross-section, while atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoinisation (APPI) both lead to dehydrated protonated molecules and an absence of molecular weight information (15-17). The major sterol in the oxysterol fraction has a m/z of 534.4054 (RA 100%) and appears with retention time (7.35 and 7.65 min, syn/anti forms of the GP hydrazone) identical to that of oxidized and derivatised 24S-hydroxycholesterol (Supplementary Table 1). As the GP hydrazone contains a quaternary nitrogen, the derivatised oxysterol gives a high ion-yield in the ES ion-source (18). The latter are intermediates in the biosynthesis of C24 bile acids, which have recently been identified in rat brain (30). The enzyme with 7α-hydroxylase activity in brain, i.e. CYP7B1, will 7α-hydroxylate both 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterols, but has much lower activity against 24S-hydroxycholesterol (28,29). The RIC for m/z 552.4160 revealed two components with retention times of 9.23 and 10.03 min. Additionally, here we have detected 5,6-seco-sterol and its aldol in rat brain. The benefit provided by the abundant neutral-loss of 79 Da for the detection of GP derivatives, proves to be a disadvantage for their structural determination. for the loss of 79 Da) and MRM scans, and quadrupole - time-of-flight instruments offer the possibility of exact mass and MS/MS analysis, ion-trap instrument have the advantage of being able to generate MSn spectra. The methodology includes derivatisation to add selectivity and enhance ionisation, exact mass analysis at high-resolution to identify potential metabolites, and LC-MS3 to allow their characterisation. An aliquot was treated with O-methyl hydroxylamine in pyridine at 23°C for 2 h and subsequently trimethylsilylated. Treatment of an aliquot with O-methyl hydroxylamine and trimethylchlorosilane afforded the aldoxime - mono-TMS derivative (the C-5 tertiary alcohol was not derivatized) which appeared as a single but broadened peak on GC-MS. Other oxysterols have also been identified in brain (9), including cholest-4-en-3-one (10), and 3β-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (11) (5,6-seco-sterol). This was again applied to the column followed by a wash with 10 mL of 10% methanol. They were then eluted with two portions of 1 mL of methanol followed by 1 mL of chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v). The derivatisation protocol has been applied to mixtures of oxosteroids on the μg–ng level and is suitable for the low level (pg) derivatisation of neutral steroids extracted from tissue (18). After 1 min at 20% B, the proportion of B was raised to 80% B over the next 7 min, and maintained at 80% B for a further 5 min, before returning to 20% B in 6 s and re-equilibration for a further 3 min 54 s, giving a total run time of 17 min. Ions from the API source, operated in the positive ES mode, are initially stored in the LIT and analysed in either MS or MSn modes.
