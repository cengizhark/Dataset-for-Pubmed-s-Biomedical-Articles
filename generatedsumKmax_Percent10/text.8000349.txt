This substrate and ligand binding trajectory supports the previously proposed scenario that during enzyme turnover O2 binds to the heme iron prior to substrate binding.30,40 It suggests that during turnover the Sa* site functions as a transient docking site to guide the sequential entry of the ligand and substrate, while the JK-LoopC operates as a gate to dynamically control the entry processes.Flash photolysis induced CO migration in heme proteins, in particular myoglobin (Mb), has been extensively studied as a mean to understand reversible ligand binding processes.41-45 Visible light illumination of Mb-CO crystals at cryogenic temperatures was shown to trap photochemical intermediates, where CO docks in a variety of well-defined docking sites.42-45 Temperature-dependent studies revealed that CO migration following photolysis is limited to the distal heme pocket because of restricted protein motions under the frozen conditions, while at a relatively higher temperature (>180 K) the photolyzed CO can further migrate to the proximal side of the heme because of the opening of additional ligand migration tunnels resulting from increased protein conformational freedom.45The CO photolysis reaction reported here represents a unique case where CO photolysis triggers large-scale translocation of not only the photolyzed CO but also the bulky substrate Trp, which is accompanied by a large conformational change to an active site loop, the JK-LoopC.
