Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants from the two families. Sanger sequencing of the KRT25 missense variant using DNA samples from the remaining members of AP188 and AP216 confirmed segregation with the ARWH phenotype in both families (figure 1A, B, see online supplementary figure S1A). The KRT25 transcript and the encoded protein are expressed in all three layers of the follicle IRS and the hair shaft medulla.3 Likewise, other type I keratins namely KRT27 and KRT28 have the same expression pattern, while of the type II keratins, only KRT71 is expressed in all three IRS layers.3 The WH phenotype observed in individuals homozygous for the KRT25 c.950T>C variant implies that heterodimerisation between K25 and K71 is essential for stable hair structure, and is not compensated by interaction of K71 with K27 or K28. The variant is predicted to disrupt the Î±-helical rod 2B domain of K25 and to interfere with heterodimerisation with type II keratins, which are expected to lead to irregular and fragile hair that is characteristic of the WH phenotype.
