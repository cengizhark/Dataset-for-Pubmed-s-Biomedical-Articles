First, the sample was drawn from a single center and only 2 operators performed a sufficient number of procedures to be compared. Patient PopulationBKP was recommended for patients with acute VCFs refractory to conservative therapy, who exhibited edema on spinal magnetic resonance images (MAGNETOM Aera; Siemens, Munich, Germany) or active technetium-99m radiotracer (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) uptake on single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (Optima NM/CT 640; GE Healthcare) bone scans, and had localized tenderness over the fractured level. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) are commonly used procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance to treat painful VCFs refractory to medical management or bracing, which remain the subject of investigation (3). Interrater agreement was considered moderate on the basis of a frequently cited scale (20, 21), which is similar to the agreement found using the current protocols for prostate cancer (22), pancreatic cancer (23), and pulmonary nodule (24). This gives the classification system utility in outcomesâ€™ trials beyond what its moderate interrater reliability suggests because the effect of related classes on outcomes is likely similar and the effect of less-related classes is divergent. It is paramount to understand interoperator variability in BKP and PVP, as the largest clinical trials, to date, have been conducted at multiple sites and have not adjusted for potential heterogeneity between operators (4, 5, 25, 26). McDonald et al  showed, in a sample of 2 operators experienced in PVP and 5 novice operators, that several procedural measures and short-term clinical outcomes significantly change as novice operators gain experience (27).
