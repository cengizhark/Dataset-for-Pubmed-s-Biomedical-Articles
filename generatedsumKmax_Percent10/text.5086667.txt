This includes a lack of information on HAART, which is likely to influence chronic condition prevalence for HIV+ beneficiaries. The objective of this study is to examine sociodemographic factors and chronic health conditions of PLWHIVaged 65 years and older, and to compare their chronic disease prevalence with beneficiaries without HIV. These chronic condition variables are used in numerous publications from both CMS and in the general literature [21,22]. Models for chronic conditions were run both with and without adjustment for variables that are either commonly included in the chronic disease literature, or are known to affect the prevalence of chronic disease; including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, a measure of socioeconomic status, and ESRD [23â€“25]. In adjusted models, persons with missing values for any adjustment variables were dropped. In adjusted models, persons with missing values for any adjustment variables were dropped. PLWHIV were also approximately five times as likely to have the current reason for Medicare enrollment be listed as ESRD, OR 4.77, 95% CI (4.03, 5.66) but were about 60% less likely to die during the time of the study, OR 0.38, 95% CI (0.36, 0.40) (Table 1), a result partially due to the younger age of HIV+ beneficiaries (data not shown). Adjusted risks for these chronic conditions ranged from aOR 1.51, 95% CI (1.47, 1.55) for diabetes to aOR 2.14, 95% CI (2.08, 2.19) for rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis (Table 3). Beneficiaries with HIV infection were also more likely than those without HIV infection to have one or more of the five most common chronic health conditions, increasing the complexity of their medical issues, care, and likelihood of ill health after age 65. Greater collaboration between infectious disease and chronic disease practitioners will be needed to ensure the appropriate medical management of these patients including complex medication regimens [31,32].
