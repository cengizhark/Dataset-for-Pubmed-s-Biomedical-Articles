If they did report RA, medical records were reviewed by 2 independent rheumatologists following strict ACR criteria to ensure accuracy of diagnosis. Different test assays might have been used in community clinical sites, which might have had different performance characteristics. Seroconversion (initially testing seronegative and later testing seropositive) or seroreversion (the opposite of seroconversion) may have occurred after diagnosis, however, this is relatively uncommon, having been reported in <5% of patients in other research studies (46, 47). In sub-group analyses, we may not have had sufficient power to detect a statistically significant association after including all relevant covariates, as can be noticed where confidence intervals were wider and less precise than in analyses of other outcomes. CovariatesParticipants’ demographic, reproductive, clinical and behavioral factors have been collected with biennial questionnaires, including age, census tract median family income, smoking, age at menarche, menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use. A validated physical activity questionnaire (25) included inquiries about time spent engaged in several discretionary physical activities per week. Abdominal obesity assessed using waist circumference (WC) has been shown in some studies to be a better measure of visceral fat (5), known to contribute to systemic inflammation (6, 7) more than adipose tissues at other anatomic sites. Exposure information was collected comparably across cohorts and the resulting larger sample size provided increased power to better assess age-specific effects. Univariate analyses were performed for covariates in unadjusted models. In multivariable analyses, we adjusted for time-varying covariates (significant in unadjusted models at p<0.10): age, cohort, smoking pack-years (0, 0–20, 20+ pack years), AHEI (quartiles), physical activity (quartiles of MET hours/week), and menopausal status and PMH use (premenopausal, and PMH never, current, or past use) (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Potential interaction of abdominal obesity (WC) by general obesity (BMI) was assessed in a separate model.
