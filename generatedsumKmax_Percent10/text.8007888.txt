The results revealed an influence of screams on the perception of fearful and neutral faces and incongruence effects of emotional valence were found in middle cingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, right supplementary motor area (SMA) and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). This reflects the relative moderate expression of fear in the fearful face condition and goes along with the less intense rating of these faces after scanning.Comparing laughs and screams to yawns activated bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is in line with previous findings on emotional vs. neutral vocalizations (Fecteau et al , 2007; Meyer et al , 2005; Phillips et al , 1998). Consequently, if the TPJ integrates sensory signals and against the expectations on these, the prediction error between bottom-up facial information and expectation built on the sound may underlie the greater TPJ activation in the incongruent condition.In summary, audiovisual emotional incongruence leads to activation of a cingulate-fronto-parietal network previously shown to be involved in conflict monitoring and resolution (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter et al , 1998; Ochsner et al , 2009; Weissman et al , 2004; Wittfoth et al , 2010). This approach has the advantage of avoiding influences of non-linear distortions between EPI and T1 images and yields a precise registration of the functional data into MNI space (see supplementary Fig. From studies in macaque monkeys it is known that the laterobasal amygdala receives direct input from auditory and visual cortices (McDonald, 1998; Yukie, 2002). Moreover, the posterior superior temporal sulcus plays also a crucial role in audiovisual integration (Beauchamp, 2005; Campanella and Belin, 2007). Finally, clinical studies in patients with depression show that this disorder goes along with a negativity bias (Drevets et al , 2008) and problems inhibiting negative information (Goeleven et al , 2006; Joormann, 2010). Hence, 35 healthy right-handed volunteers (20 females; mean age 29.4 ± 8.1 years, mean education 14.1 ± 3.2, 15 males; mean age 34.0 ± 13.3, mean education 14.5 ± 3.2) were included in the analysis. Hence, 35 healthy right-handed volunteers (20 females; mean age 29.4 ± 8.1 years, mean education 14.1 ± 3.2, 15 males; mean age 34.0 ± 13.3, mean education 14.5 ± 3.2) were included in the analysis. Men and women did not significantly differ in age (t33 = 1.29, ns.) Men and women did not significantly differ in age (t33 = 1.29, ns.) All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were right handed as confirmed by the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). The structured clinical interview of DSM IV (SCID; Wittchen et al , 1997) was used to screen the subjects revealing no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders including substance abuse. Non-emotional conflict has been studied extensively using behavioural and neuroimaging experiments (Botvinick et al , 2004; Carter et al , 1998; Carter and van Veen, 2007; Durston et al , 2003; Egner and Hirsch, 2005; Kerns et al , 2004; MacDonald et al , 2000; Ochsner et al , 2009; Weissman et al , 2004). The resulting parameters of a discrete cosine transform, which define the deformation field necessary to move the subjects data into the space of the MNI tissue probability maps, were then combined with the deformation field transforming between the latter and the MNI single subject template. The ensuing deformation was subsequently applied to the individual EPI volumes that were hereby transformed into the MNI single subject space and resampled at 2×2×2 mm3 voxel size. The resulting SPM (T) maps were then thresholded at p <0.05, correcting for multiple comparisons by controlling the family-wise error (FWE) rate according to the theory of Gaussian random fields (Worsley et al , 1996).
