This was further validated by a DNA pulldown assay utilizing biotinylated oligonucleotides containing a previously characterized TRE. Revealing common features can aid in understanding the metachronous nature of the two diseases. Supp Table 1 Further understanding of either of these tumor types may reveal important insights into the predisposition for the other disease as well as insights into how both tumor types develop. Reciprocal synergies between these tumors may be highly informative. Specific proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (Supplementary Table 2). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR).Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP).Binding to RUNX2 chromatin was determined by ChIP-PCR. Cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche) and chromatin was extracted and sonicated to 200–500 bp in size using a Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator. Complexes were washed extensively, eluted, and incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-links. Fold binding over IgG was determined by qRT-PCR. Fold binding over IgG was determined by qRT-PCR. MyOne T1 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) were rinsed twice with binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.6), incubated with 5 ng of biotinylated probe at 4°C for 1 hour, and then washed twice with binding buffer. Statistics.All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Similar results were observed in triple negative MDA-MB-468 cells.
