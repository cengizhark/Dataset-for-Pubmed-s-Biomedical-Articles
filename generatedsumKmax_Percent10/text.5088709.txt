Second, our study was observational and thus may be subject to ecological fallacy, that is, drawing conclusions for individuals based on group level data (45). Third, data on comorbid conditions were subject to the limitations of the medical evidence form – limited sensitivity for certain conditions, lack of information on disease severity – and was collected at dialysis initiation while our outcome was measured over time (46). An additional limitation is that we did not fully explore the role of preemptive waitlisting on regional or racial disparities. African Americans and whites have disparate distribution among UNOS regions; therefore, we sought to determine whether regional disparities are an underappreciated cause of racial disparities or if racial disparities within regions contribute to regional disparities. In addition, in an exploratory analysis, preemptively waitlisted patients over the same time period were added to the cohort to explore the impact of preemptive waitlisting on racial and regional disparities.Several data sources were used for this analysis. Socio-demographic and clinical information from dialysis initiation was gathered from the USRDS medical evidence form. Socio-demographic and clinical information from dialysis initiation was gathered from the USRDS medical evidence form. We censored patients at the time of living donor transplant, death, and the end of the observation period, June 30, 2010. This information was available through September 2010. Geographic variation has been examined as a factor contributing to access to kidney transplantation (13–19). The C statistic was higher for the model with race/region interaction which indicates a better model fit.In Regions 3 and 4, two regions with a large regional disparity overall (HR 0.76 and 0.82 compared to US average, respectively), the overall regional disparity in time to transplant waitlist is driven by the racial disparity.
