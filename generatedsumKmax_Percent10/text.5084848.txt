There were no patients with pre-existing pelvic fractures, pelvic fractures diagnosed on pretreatment imaging, or bony metastases. Comparisons of categorical variables between groups were performed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests if necessary. Comparisons of continuous variables between groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. The median external beam radiation dose was 45.0 grays (Gy) (range, 38.8â€“68.3 Gy), and was followed by 2 intracavitary implants with low-dose-rate brachytherapy in the majority of patients (n = 241; 93%). The median follow-up for all patients was 20.9 months and the median time from the end of treatment to last imaging was 7.4 months. In addition, Oh et al16 noted a weight <55 kg to be a significant predisposing factor for pelvic insufficiency fractures among Korean women treated with pelvic radiotherapy. In addition, to our knowledge, there are few data available regarding pelvic fractures and osteoporosis in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for gynecologic malignancies. The prevention of osteoporosis and pelvic fractures may result in improved survivorship in women undergoing radiotherapy for gynecologic malignancies.
