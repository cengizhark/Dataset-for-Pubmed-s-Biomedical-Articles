We compared CBF measurements with multiple ASL techniques against the PET reference standard in patients with Moyamoya disease under simultaneous conditions. LLLD ASL showed the least bias in rCBF values compared with PET, enabling reliable CBF assessment even in areas of severe Tmax delay. The study was performed in compliance with the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, and all patients provided written informed consent before the study. DSC MRI was performed using 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium contrast injected at 4 mL/s at the end of the study. This study evaluated the accuracy of several ASL MRI acquisitions to measure cerebral perfusion in patients with Moyamoya disease compared with reference [15O]-water PET scans acquired simultaneously on a hybrid system. These regions have long transit delays relative to the PLD, leading to artificially low ASL signal that is a known confounder in highly collateralized brain regions.13 More recently, Hara et al23 observed that ASL with a single PLD of 2.5 seconds, which is similar to our standard PLD, outperformed ASL with a shorter PLD of 1.5 seconds in areas of Moyamoya disease (Tmax > 6 seconds). Previous work found that multidelay ASL more strongly correlated with computed tomographic perfusion than single-delay ASL (PLD of 2 seconds) in Moyamoya patients.25 Two-compartment modeling of multidelay ASL26 has shown 27% longer ATTâ€™s in the affected side compared with the contralateral side, similar to the 31% ATT elevation we observed in regions with moderate Tmax. This observation may reflect earlier blood arrival combined with faster T1 relaxation in the tissue compared with the blood, which leads to underestimation of both ATT and CBF in early-arrival regions at longer PLDs.17 It may also help explain why LLLD ASL did not perform as well as multidelay ASL in cases of moderate Tmax.
