Covariates, such as education, sex, and ethnicity, were not associated with these outcomes and were not included in the final model. For patients counseled by pharmacists, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups from baseline to 12 months for the 5 A’s (Table 3). This study used the most rigorous design7 to estimate the impact of a tobacco cessation counseling program in a group-randomized trial among physicians and community pharmacists. The content of the tobacco and sun-protection training for physicians and pharmacists was similar, with differences specific to their professional activities. Training was provided for the control group to establish balance between the 2 study arms, in terms of providers’ dedication and interest in being trained in cancer prevention. Owing to logistical issues, not all the providers could be surveyed at both follow-up time points; therefore, we consolidated the data obtained at 6 and 12 months into 1 (extended) follow-up data pool. Interitem correlation coefficients, Cronbach α, and principal axis factor analysis were used to evaluate the validity of the index. All item loadings on the extracted factor were at least 0.40. Providers were classified on the ACI index with 2 well-defined groups: those with higher scores on ACI (3 on all measures) and those with lower scores on ACI (<3 on at least 1 measure). The results were summarized using type III tests of fixed effects, F statistics, and P values. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTIONProvider recruitment and retention by condition are presented in Figure 1. At baseline, a total of 1571 patients were originally approached, and 119 refused to participate; 1452 completed baseline exit interviews. However, because 12-month follow-up data collection occurred in the same clinics and pharmacies located in the same communities as baseline, there is reason to believe the refusal rate was similar to baseline. Thirty-four percent were of Hispanic/Latino origin, 52% had completed high school or less, 27% had some college education, and 22% were college graduates. Thirty-four percent of patients were of Hispanic/Latino origin, 52% had completed high school or less, 26% had some college education, and 22% were college graduates.
