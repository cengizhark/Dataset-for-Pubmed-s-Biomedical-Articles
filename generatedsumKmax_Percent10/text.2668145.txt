Golgi staining was used to visualize individualvmPFC neurons in layer 2/3 and to analyze dendritic complexity in BDNFMet/Met as well as in BDNF+/− mice. Our data provide several new insights into phenotypes associated with the variant BDNFMet. In all, our study demonstrates one strategy for how to use model systems of human SNP's to identify novel behavioral phenotypes and novel pharmacologic approaches to treat anxiety disorders. Mice were housed in cages in which they had ad libitum access to food, but restricted (from 09:00 to 9:30 h) access to water presented in two bottles. On days 1, 3, 7 and 30 post-training, the two bottle choice test was administered to determine the degree of CTA acquisition and retention (n=10 for each genotype per each retention test). To determine the degree of CTA extinction, the two bottle choice test was repeated for 15 consecutive days post-conditioning. On the 25th day, the two-bottle selective test was repeated in order to evaluate spontaneous recovery of the extinguished CTA memory. Control animals were injected intraperitoneally with corresponding amounts of saline. Coronal sections were serially cut at 20 µm using a freezing microtome. For stereological analysis, 40 μm serial coronal sections were cut throughout whole brain using a freezing sliding microtome. ImmunohistochemistryEvery fourth serially obtained section (60 μm interval) was mounted and processed for c-Fos immunohistochemical staining. Sections were incubated for 20 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase, rinsed (3×, PBS), and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with polyclonal anti-Fos (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; Catalog No. sc253) at 4°C for 24 h followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Elite kit, Vector Laboratories) incubation. Brains were then embedded in a 3% agarose solution, blocked, and cut at room temperature on a vibratome (150 μm sections). The morphological traits of cells (Fractal dimension analysis) were analyzed using Neuroexplorer, and data were processed and statistical analyses were done using Prism 4.0. Data analyses were performed using SPSS statistical program version 10.0. Unconditioned taste preferencesDuring the initial two-bottle unconditioned taste preference test, preference of four taste solutions (sweet, salty, bitter, and acidic) over water was measured. On the second test day, all genotypes preferred the 0.5% sodium saccharin to water (genotype, F(3,37) = 0.35, p = 0.79; Figure 1A), preferred water slightly to 75 mM NaCl (genotype, F(3,37) = 0.99, p = 0.43; Figure 1B), and avoided 0.02% quinine sulfate (genotype, F(3,37) = 0.39, p = 0.76; Figure 1C) and 0.01 M HCl solutions (genotype, F(3,37) = 0.89, p = 0.48; Figure 1D). Acquisition of CTA memoryMice of all genotypes readily consumed the sodium saccharin solution on the day of conditioning (mean±SEM saccharin solution intake: wild type, 1.53±0.17 ml; BDNF+/Met, 1.76±0.23 ml; BDNFMet/Met, 2.07±0.46 ml; BDNF+/−, 2.10±0.16 ml; genotype, F(3,71) = 2.20, p = 0.15). Comparison among the groups revealed no significant differences across genotypes (genotype, F(3,39) = 0.85, p = 0.48 for 30-day retention test; Figure 3).
