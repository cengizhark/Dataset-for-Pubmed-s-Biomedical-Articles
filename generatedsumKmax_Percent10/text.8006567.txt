Additional evidence that sex hormones may be involved comes from the observation that castrated NOD/ShiLtJ male mice display SS-like clinical features similar to females while ovariectomized females show the opposite effect.55,56 Testosterone treatment of female mice has been shown to reduce salivary gland inflammation.57 Finally, Th17 cells from a C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 SS-like mouse model show increased proliferation only in females.58 Together, these studies indicate a potential role for sex hormones in SS that could be further explored by quantifying SPMs in castrated and ovariectomized mice. 2.2 |Saliva collectionMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylaxine (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine), and injected with pilocarpine-HCl/PBS (Sigma) at 10 mg/kg via i.p to stimulate saliva secretion. 2.2 |Saliva collectionMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylaxine (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine), and injected with pilocarpine-HCl/PBS (Sigma) at 10 mg/kg via i.p to stimulate saliva secretion. 2.3 |Plasma collectionMice were euthanized with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Samples were held at −80°C for 1 hour to allow for protein precipitation and centrifuged. Supernatants were collected and concentrated to less than 1 mL of methanol content under nitrogen flow in an automated evaporation system (TurboVap LV, Biotage). A Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (4.6×100 mm, 2.7 micron particle size) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) guarded by a Security Guard Ultra C18 precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) were used for HPLC separation, see Table S2. After 2 minutes at 50% of solvent B (A: 0.01% acetic acid in water; B: 0.01% acetic acid in methanol), analytes were separated by a linear gradient up to 80% of solvent B over 9.0 minutes and the concentration of solvent B was maintained at 80% for 3.5 minutes. The column was subsequently washed for 5.5 minutes at 98% B and re-equilibrated with 80% of solvent A over 3.0 minutes. Similarly, all arachidonic acid (AA)-derived products had an approximately >40-fold increase in plasma from post-disease female mice as compared to their pre-disease counterparts (Figure 2A) where specific SPM levels were statistically significantly upregulated (eg, leukotriene B4 [LTB4], Prostaglandin D2 [PGD2], Prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], Figure 2B). Likewise, no differences were observed in RvD2 levels at the same time points (Figure 5B,D). In males, no significant differences in the expression of these biosynthetic enzymes were observed between the post-disease and pre-disease groups (Figure 6A). Together, these results indicate that expression of SPM-biosynthetic enzymes is dysregulated in SMG of females but not male NOD/ShiLtJ mice after disease onset.
