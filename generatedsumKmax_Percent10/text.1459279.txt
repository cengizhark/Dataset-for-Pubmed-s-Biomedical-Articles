This eliminated possible build up of chemoattractant or ionic gradients and maintained a stable temperature and pH across the chamber during experiments. Directional sensing is sometimes distinct from cell polarization in Dictyostelium (Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003), and cell polarization indicated by polarization of Golgi apparatus (Golgi polarization) can sometimes be uncoupled from cell migration in fibroblasts (Magdalena et al , 2003a; Magdalena et al , 2003b). PI 3-kinase signalling is the compass mechanism in chemotactic directional sensing in Dictyostelium, neutrophils and fibroblasts (Ilijima and Devreotes, 2002; Servant et al , 2000; Xu et al , 2003; Firtel and Chung, 2000; Haugh et al , 2000). Y27632 was used to inhibit p160ROCK and Toxin B was used as a general inhibitor of Rho, Rac and Cdc42. These include chemoattractant gradients (Nabi, 1999; Xu et al , 2003; Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003), mechanical forces (Li et al , 2002; Decave et al , 2003; Wojciak-Stothard and Ridley, 2003) and gradients of adhesiveness (Libotte et al , 2001). However, BFA treatment did significantly inhibit electrotaxis by reducing the directedness value from 0.93 in to 0.28 (compare Fig. Chemical gradients inevitably form at the wound (Hansen et al , 1993; Sammak et al , 1997; Klepeis et al , 2001). This supports the notion that Golgi polarization is not essential for the EF-directed cell movement, but rather permits optimal directional migration in this large electric field. Therefore, Golgi polarization in single cells should be mainly due to the direct effects of the applied EF, rather than indirect means.In the monolayer wound-healing model however, chemical gradients would inevitably form (Hansen et al , 1993; Sammak et al , 1997; Klepeis et al , 2001). Golgi polarization versus Golgi dispersal and directional cell migrationBFA, at high concentrations causes rapid dispersal of Golgi apparatus into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Presley et al , 1998; Sciaky et al , 1997; Hirschberg et al , 1998). Golgi polarization in response to extracellular cuesScratch-wounding monolayer cultures of fibroblast, astrocytes and endothelial cells generates reproducible and consistent cues to induce Golgi polarization (Etienne-Manneville et al , 2001; Etienne-Manneville et al , 2003; Nobes and Hall, 1999; Magdalena et al , 2003a; Magdalena et al , 2003b). Intracellular signalling mechanisms of EF-induced Golgi polarization and electrotaxisPI 3-kinase and Src are required for Golgi polarization in the directional cell migration of fibroblast cells (Haugh et al , 2000; Magdalena et al , 2003a). 6).Before Golgi polarization in the EF direction, cells moved more in the direction Golgi polarizes than towards the cathode. CO2- independent medium was used for experiments performed in room atmosphere. 1 coverglass was applied and sealed with DC4 on top of the chamber as described (Zhao et al , 1996). The dish was placed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with temperature control at 37Â°C. lamellipodia or pseudopodia where active membrane protrusion occurs (Ridley et al , 2003; Manes et al , 2003; Jaffe and Hall, 2003; Nabi, 1999; Xu et al , 2003; Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003). Migration rate was analysed with the following three parameters. Electric field-directed Golgi polarization and asymmetric actin polymerizationIn CHO cells cultured in an applied EF of 300 mV/mm both the Golgi apparatus and actin filaments polarized towards the cathode (Fig.
