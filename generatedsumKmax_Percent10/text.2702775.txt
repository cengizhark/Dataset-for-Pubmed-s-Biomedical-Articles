Loss of Rac proteins, therefore, has a stronger morphological phenotype than loss of PAK1. PAK1 affects both the actin cytoskeleton (Edwards et al , 1999; Sanders et al , 1999) and the microtubule network (Daub et al , 2001; Wittmann et al , 2004), and is thereby implicated in cell migration (Adam et al , 1998; Ching et al , 2007; Sells et al , 1999; Zhou et al , 2003), phagocytosis (Dharmawardhane et al , 1999; Diakonova et al , 2002) and cell spreading in platelets (Suzuki-Inoue et al , 2001) and fibroblasts (ten Klooster et al , 2006). PAK1 could also affect cell shape via regulation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Although the MAPKs are typically associated with regulation of transcription, they also affect cell migration and adhesion. After 24 hours, transmigrated cells were fixed and stained using the REASTAIN Quick-Diff kit (Reagena). An image frame was collected every 10 minutes for 8 hours using Kinetic Imaging Motion Analysis software (Andor Technology). From these movies, the number of lamellipodia was quantitated at different timepoints, and the perimeter length of individual lamellipodia was measured using Metamorph 5.01 (Universal Imaging Systems). Lamellipodial extension dynamics were analysed on kymographs generated from the time-lapse movies (Metamorph 5.0.1). The C19 antibody also showed that there was no change in PAK2 protein expression in PAK1−/− BMMs. Similar surface levels of the macrophage differentiation marker F4/80 (Hirsch et al , 1981) were observed in Wt and PAK1−/− BMMs, indicating that loss of PAK1 did not prevent CSF-1-mediated macrophage differentiation (Fig. PAK1 phosphorylation was increased by 2 minutes, and returned to basal levels by 10 minutes. 1D) or c-Raf on S338 (S. D. Smith and A. J. Ridley, unpublished), both described as PAK substrates, was not altered in PAK1−/− BMMs, indicating that deletion of PAK1 alone is not sufficient to affect these sites.PAK1 is required for chemotaxis but not translocation of leukocytes and HEK293 cells stimulated with ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors (Li et al , 2003; Wang et al , 2002). 3A, Supplementary movies 3 and 4). This is consistent with the time-lapse data indicating that PAK1−/− BMM lamellipodia are less stable and collapse before they can encompass large lengths of the cell perimeter. MEK1/2 activity, as measured by phosphorylation of S217/221 (Alessi et al , 1994) was not altered in PAK1−/− BMMs before or 10 minutes after adhesion (Fig.
