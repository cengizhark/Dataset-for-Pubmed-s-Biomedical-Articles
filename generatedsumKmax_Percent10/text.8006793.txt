However, the ASL signal is strongly dependent on the time the blood takes to reach the tissue of interest from the labeling plane. Therefore, ASL using a single post-label delay might not properly reflect the true CBF, while an ASL acquisition with multiple post-label delay times might mitigate this effect [10]. Other parameters were as follows: TR = 4844 ms, TE = 11 ms, time of labeling = 2 s, post-label delays = 0.7, 1.3,1.9, 2.5, and 3.0 s, field of view = 240 × 240 mm2, number of slices = 36, voxel size = 6 × 6 × 5 mm3, and NEX = 1, scan time = 3:36 min (which includes all five post-label delay times and a proton density images required to calculate CBF). [2] in Dai et al  [10])) average was used to determine the final CBF. (3) Sub-clinical, “pre-stroke”, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes post-acetazolamide challenge were studied as function of baseline ATT, change in ATT, or CVR. Significance level was set to α < 0.05 and corrected for false discovery rate using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Representative examples of pre- and post-acetazolamide imaging of CBF, ATT, and ADC in several patients are shown in Fig. This suggests that there is an increase in flow velocity between labeling plane and imaging plane, but it is not possible to figure out whether this increase arises predominantly in smaller or larger arteries. Yun et al  [20] found a significant increase in CVR with ASL and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in moyamoya patients 6 months after bypass surgery.
