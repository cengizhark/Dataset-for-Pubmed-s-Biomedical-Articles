Baseline salivary cortisol and self-reported state negative affectivity and state anxiety were first collected 5–10 min after laboratory arrival. Dispositional MeasuresMindfulnessThe 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003) assessed the frequency of open attentiveness to and awareness of present events and experiences using a 6-point Likert scale (almost always to almost never). Samples were collected via 2-min sublingual placement of synthetic Salivettes (Salimetrics, State College, PA) at baseline, immediately after the speech task (10 min from task onset), and 10, 20, and 35 min after the tasks (20, 30, and 45 min from task onset). Inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 6.69—6.88%, intra-assay CV was 3.88—7.12%, and the sensitivity was < 0.007 ug/dL.AnxietyThe POMS anxiety subscale assessed anxiety “currently” at baseline (α = .88), and at 10, 20, and 35 min after the tasks (20, 30, and 45 min from task onset).Negative affectivityThe NA portion of the PANAS assessed negative affectivity “right now” (baseline α = .87) on the same assessment schedule as with POMS anxiety. However the stress buffering effects held when controlling for these study variables.
