For each subject, single-shot full Fourier dMRI data were acquired using a twice-refocused dMRI pulse sequence to reduce eddy current artifacts.16 The following imaging parameters were employed for all 3 subjects: TE = 110 ms, TR = 5300 ms, FOV = 222 × 222 mm2, acquisition matrix = 74 × 74, slice thickness = 3 mm, number of slices = 42, phase encoding acceleration factor (GRAPPA) = 2, slice acceleration factor = 2, coil combine mode = adaptive combine, bandwidth = 1648 Hz/px, number of diffusion encoding directions = 128, and b-values = 1000, 2000, and 6000 s/mm2. For CSD, the fODFs were generated by MRTrix3 (http://www.mrtrix.org/) using the ‘fa’ algorithm.23 For FBI, the fODFs were obtained using the inverse generalized Funk transform with intra-axonal diffusivity upper bound parameter D0 set to 3.0 μm2/ms.5,6 With both techniques, the fODFs were represented in terms of spherical harmonics including all even degrees up to 8. 6 where the parameter ε was determined by solving Eq. This number of directions corresponds to an angular resolution of about 2°, which is small in comparison to the angular scale over which the estimated fODFs vary significantly.The FAA for all fODFs was determined using the formula10(18) FAA =3∑m=−22|c2m|25|c00|2+2∑m=−22|c2m|2. In order to calculate the FAA from Eq. Then we apply the method to both CSD and FBI fODFs estimated using dMRI data obtained from 3 healthy volunteers for a b-value of 6000 s/mm2. Rectification was seen to reduce the FAA and the total number of detected peaks with these effects being more substantial for CSD. Although we have no ground truth to confirm an improved accuracy for in vivo data, the small peaks that it suppresses are prone to being altered by signal noise and imaging artifacts. Without loss of generality, we assume the antipodal symmetry F(−n) = F(n) and the normalization condition 6 and that there is a unique solution for ε are sketched in the Appendix. where φ is the azimuthal angle for n, Ylm(θ,φ) are the spherical harmonics of degree l and order m, and clm are the expansion coefficients. where Pl(x) is a Legendre polynomial of degree l and δmn is the Kronecker delta.
