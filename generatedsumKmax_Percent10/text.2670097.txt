), mouse anti-alpha-tubulin and rabbit anti-gamma tubulin (Sigma Aldrich), and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa dyes (Invitrogen). The assay was performed by using a commercial kit (Roche Scientific) following the instructions. In principle, cells were plated on 96-well dishes one day before the drug treatment, followed by drug treatment on day 2 and XTT assay on day 5 after drug addition. ChemistryAll reagents were used as received from commercial sources, unless specified otherwise, or prepared as described in the literature. We have recently identified small molecules INH1 and INH2 that can effectively suppress tumor cell growth in culture and in animals via directly targeting the Hec1/Nek2 mitotic pathway 10. Although both of them inhibit the proliferation of multiple human breast cancer cell lines in culture, the potency in killing cancer cells and the water solubility remain to be improved for better efficacy.

ChemistryOur synthesis embarked on the preparation of two intermediates 3 and 4 followed by the general synthetic procedure shown in Scheme 1. {Benzoyl-[4-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)thiazol-2-yl]amino}acetic acid (31)Compound 30 (75 mg, 0.18 mmol) was dissolved in CH3CN (6 mL). H2O (20 mL) was added to quench the reaction and HCl (1M, 3 mL) was added. To the resultant solution, HBr (0.6 ml, 5.3 mmol) and tBuOOH (0.6 mL, 5.0-6.0M in hexane, ∼3.4 mmol) were added subsequently. This oil (169 mg) was dissolved in EtOH (4 mL) and thiourea (59 mg, 0.78 mmol) was added. That is, once INH2 was treated with NaH in THF, the two MeO groups would result in the formation of two intermediates 28 and 29 in tautomeric equilibrium. Although multiple combined modality treatment strategies are available and continue to be improved, seeking for alternative therapeutics with a better therapeutic index remains a top priority of the drug development endeavors. Furthermore, a steric contribution to the observed selectivity (higher yield of 27) should also be taken into account as the ortho methoxy group would be occupying the same place as the methyl added to the amide nitrogen. Upon removal of the benzoyl groups from INH1 and INH2, the resultant thiazolyl amine 3 and 4 did not exhibit any anti-proliferative activity even at > 40 μM, indicating that benzoyl moiety is indispensable. Additionally, deletion of the para-methoxyl group in INH2 resulted in the dramatic loss of bioactivity (7) and replacement of the methoxyl group in 7 with trifluoromethyl group would efficiently improve the bioactivity by approximately 1.5-2 fold (8). Target validation of INH analoguesNext, target validation was performed by using an affinity pulldown assay described previously 10. Importantly, overexpression of Hec1 has been documented to associate with poor clinical outcomes of primary breast cancers as well as cases with multiple cancers 5, 6.
