The purpose of this study is to compare the growth factor and cytokine content found within the amnion and chorion layers and to determine the effects of dehydration on these signaling molecules. Fresh chorion contained more of some signaling molecules per cm2 compared with amnion, and both dehydrated samples saw a significant drop in total growth factor and cytokine content (51.1% ± 20.2% for amnion; 55.5% ± 37.3% for chorion).
