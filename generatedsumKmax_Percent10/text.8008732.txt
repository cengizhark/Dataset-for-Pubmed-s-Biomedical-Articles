This view of ERβ as purely suppressive in cancer is inadequate, given the growing body of evidence demonstrating ERβ activation in ERα-negative cancers is proliferative [14,15]. Though TNBC lacks ERα, nuclear and extranuclear localized ERβ is expressed in TNBC tumor specimens [24,25], and both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ERβ is proliferative in the absence of ERα [26,27]. ERβ activation in ER− breast cancer stem cells (BSCs) increased mammosphere growth, and ERβ knockdown with shRNA in TNBC xenografts reduced tumor volume by 50%. The physiological actions of estrogens are largely mediated though the activities of nuclear hormone receptors NR3A1 (ERα) and NR3A2 (ERβ), which act in cell, tissue, and temporally specific fashions to regulate complex and dynamic gene-expression networks. The role of estrogens in suppressing androgenic actions (through the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and negative luteinizing hormone feedback) in PCa has been noted for over 70 years [39]. Further epidemiological evidence indicates that the ratio of circulating testosterone to E2 is significant to the progression of PCa; low testosterone and/or high E2 was associated with higher risk of PCa. ERβ activation in the prostate is typically tumor suppressive, with ERβ agonists displaying anti-proliferative activity in cell and mouse models of prostate cancer [45,46]. In vitro models have also shown that ERβ2 can upregulate several proteins associated with osteolytic metastasis [53]. Secreted neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are highly expressed in granule and Purkinje cells and may be involved in mediating the expression of ERβ during cerebellar development [55].
