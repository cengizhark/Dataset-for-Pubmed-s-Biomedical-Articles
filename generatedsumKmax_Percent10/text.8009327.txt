The 2016 KRHS enrolled women aged 15–49 years for a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. Subsequently, households within the selected enumeration area were randomly selected from a listing. Data from only the most recent birth for each woman was used. Goodness-of-fit of the linear model was assessed using the R2, plot of residuals, and linktest command in Stata.19 Use of sampling weights excluded estimation of some regression diagnostic parameters but also provided robustness to model misspecification.20 The variables with the highest loadings on the first component included ever giving a urine or blood sample (0.35 and 0.34, respectively), having blood pressure or height measured at least once (0.30 and 0.27, respectively), being tested for HIV (0.26), and being advised to develop a birth plan (0.24). The median value of the transformed score was 25 (IQR 115–138) and was left-skewed (Fig. There was a statistically significant interaction between level of education and participation in religious services at least weekly. Number of visits and timing of initiation of care, having height and weight measured, being tested for HIV, receiving malarial prophylaxis, and reporting receiving key counseling messages about pregnancy complications and birth preparation were also important components of quality. In that analysis, among women in low-income countries, 85% had blood pressure measured, 72% had blood sample taken, and 62% had urine samples taken.
