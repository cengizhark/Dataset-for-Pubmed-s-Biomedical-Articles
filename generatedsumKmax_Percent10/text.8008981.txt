Combined with numerous other studies finding it to be an independent predictor of mortality,9,13,15,16,19,21,28-31 age represents a robust prognosticator that clinicians can easily use at the bedside. Although various consensus documents and expert panels highlight advanced age as a relative contraindication to ECMO,5,34,35 our study provides granularity to this recommendation and can help to inform future guidelines. Patients were primarily cannulated in the operating room (49.9%) or intensive care unit (23.8%), with a minority cannulated in the catheterization laboratory (5.0%) or emergency department (0.3%). OutcomesIn our cohort, 60% of patients (n = 433) died during hospitalization, consistent with prior reports.9,14,17,24 Data from a large, international registry of more than 300 ECMO centers, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, demonstrated a 41% survival to discharge for patients who had ECMO initiated for cardiac etiologies.4 This survival rate is similar to that found in an analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, where 43.3% of patients treated with ECMO between 2007 and 2014 survived to discharge.25 In that study, 3.5% of patients were bridged to LVAD, similar to a recent analysis of the Society for Thoracic Surgeons database, which demonstrates that, of 19,825 patients receiving durable MCS between January 2008 and December 2017, only 933 patients (4.7%) were bridged via ECMO.26 Compared with other critically ill patients (Interagency for Mechanical Circulatory Support profile 1), patients requiring ECMO had an inferior 12-month survival, although a high hazard for death occurred in the first 6 months after MCS implantation. Duke Clinical Research Institute served as the data coordinating and statistical analysis center.
