Thus, the mutated CD4 expression is expected to be practical to enhance the reactivity of the majority of TCRs derived from CD4 T cells. Alpha and beta chain gene constructs from the TCR 1B11 were cloned into a MSCV-based vector encoding the neomycin-resistant or puromycin-resistant gene, respectively. 3.1.Responsiveness to antigens by 5KC T cell hybridomas expressing endogenous murine CD4We selected five TCRs expressed by T cell clones that were isolated from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, which is the immune-mediated form of diabetes, having the high genetic risk HLA-DQ8 gene (Yang et al , 2014; Eerligh et al , 2011) to be expressed on 5KC T cell hybridomas. The clone 5 TCR was isolated from a T cell clone that is derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pulsed with insulin B:6–22, whereas the other four clones (T1D-3, T1D-4, T1D-10, and 1B11) were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were enriched based on specificity to a mimotope of insulin B:9–23 having a substitution of arginine with glutamic acid at position 22 (insulin B:9–23R22E, amino acid sequence shown in Table 1), therefore respond to insulin B:9–23R22E more strongly than the native insulin B:9–23 peptide (Yang et al , 2014). 1, blue inverse-triangles [expressing human CD4] vs. black diamonds [no manipulation]). Importantly, not only were the intensities of the responses elevated, but also responsiveness was seen to lower concentrations of peptides. In summary, expression of the mutated human CD4, which binds to HLA-DQ8 with greater affinity and thereby enhances affinity of the primary TCR-pMHC interaction, increased sensitivity to antigen stimulation as measured by IL-2 secretion by 5KC T cell transductants. In addition, the minimum peptide concentration by which IL-2 production is detectable was unaltered by introducing the additional CD3 genes. 4, red triangles vs. black diamonds and blue inverse triangles).
