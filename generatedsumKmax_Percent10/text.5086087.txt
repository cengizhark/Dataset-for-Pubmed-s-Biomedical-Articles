Since the formulation of the Modern Synthesis the theory holds that the environment is limited in its contribution to the evolutionary course of action – it affects selection, but not the degree of variation [1,2]. Stable RNAi-mediated methylation of DNA cannot explain inheritance seen in worms, since in C.elegans cytosine methylation does not seem to occur [20] suggesting alternative RNAi inheritance mechanisms are utilized as well. Recent evidence in worms suggests, however, that RNAi inheritance can involve a nuclear RNAi mechanism and chromatin remodeling genes as well [22]. RNAi inheritance maintained by chromatin remodeling factors (HDA-4, K03D10.3, ISW-1 and MRG-1 [22]) was shown to persist almost indefinitely (>80 generations) in the absence of the original trigger [22]. Moreover, HRDE-1 is found in oocytes nuclei but not in differentiated sperm nuclei [27], although RNAi is most efficiently transmitted via sperm [17]. RNAi mutants, but not wild type worms, were shown to be susceptible to artificial viral replication [31–33], and recently RNAi-dependency was proven essential for resistance against a natural virus (the Orsay virus) as well [34]. Recent experiments suggest that C.elegans worms which are infected with the natural Orsay virus also develop RNAi-based protection which is accumulated over generations, so that the progeny of the infected worms is essentially immuned (Personal communication [37]). Recent experiments suggest that C.elegans worms which are infected with the natural Orsay virus also develop RNAi-based protection which is accumulated over generations, so that the progeny of the infected worms is essentially immuned (Personal communication [37]). A clue to the mechanism might be found in Drosophila, where in cells such integration was shown to be achieved by the reverse transcriptase activity of transposons, resulting in establishment of an anti-viral RNAi response [57]. In Drosophila germ cells specific genomic loci act as “traps” catching transposons that land in them when the mobile element jumps. Once the transposon is captured, its expression is restricted, since the DNA is wrapped up by heterochromatin. piRNAs that are synthesized from the transposon’s landing site continuously recruit chromatin remodeling genes to the site. Since piRNAs are amplifiable, this transposon memorization is transgenerational.
