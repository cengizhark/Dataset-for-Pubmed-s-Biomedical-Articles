Data were weighted to account for unequal probabilities of selection and both facility and patient nonresponse. In accordance with the federal human subjects protection regulations at 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46.101c and 46.102d [12] and with the guidelines for defining public health research and public health non-research [13], MMP was determined to be a nonresearch, public health surveillance activity used for disease control program or policy purposes. We estimated each of these three outcomes separately by year and stratified by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Beta-coefficients for year represent the average percentage point change from 1 year to the next. Increased access to medications and better adherence may have also played a role in these improvements. Using data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP), a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults in care, we estimated trends from 2009 to 2013 in ART prescription and viral suppression among persons receiving HIV clinical care. The significant increases in ART prescription and viral suppression among young people and non-Hispanic blacks are encouraging, but a sustained focus on addressing social determinants of health for access to and delivery of clinical care and supportive services is needed for elimination of these disparities.
