Therefore, we constructed an urge-tic network using the coordinates of brain areas recruited before and at tic onset as nodes.12 We also added the right dAI that demonstrated robust activity during suppression of urge to blink as a node to our urge-tic network.4 We tested this urge-tic network using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data previously obtained from TS patients and matched controls15 and examined the behavior of the right dAI within this network using graph theoretical network analysis. Imaging data analysisResting-state fMRIThe resting-state fMRI data were analyzed using the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software.19 The afni_proc.py script for preprocessing and @ANATICOR script for artifact detection and removal from resting-state time series were used as previously described.15,20 We removed the first three EPI volumes and slice time- and motion-corrected the rest of them. 1A, Table 1, Supplementary Data).We then extracted the BOLD signal time courses from spheres with a radius of 5 mm centered on each node. The differences in clustering and local efficiency did not reach our significance criteria. The highly engaged striatothalamic nodes would then provide the cues facilitating tic release through the “loosened” frontal control gates.Consistent with its role in awareness, the insula is also part of the mesocorticolimbic reward system and shows drug-cue reactivity in addiction leading to cravings.42 Indeed, deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the insula combined with exposure to smoking cues was effective in smoking cessation.43 We think that our findings also have therapeutic implications and propose that stimulating the right dAI, for instance using rTMS, might be a promising treatment strategy to control the urge to tic in TS.
