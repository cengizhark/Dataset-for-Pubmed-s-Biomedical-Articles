We have used the CI framework to build cross-sector collaboration and establish a common agenda of obesity prevention in early-life clinical and public health services co-located at three community health centers, which has in turn informed the design of the First 1000 Days program to reduce obesity risk factors among low-income mother-infant pairs and close the gap in obesity disparities. All three communities have higher percentages of low-income residents than the state as a whole and childhood obesity rates substantially higher than the state-wide average (Table 2). Screening surveys are distributed at check-in by front desk staff, are available in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Arabic, and take approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. All patients are sent a personalized resource guide by mail or email summarizing the information discussed on the phone call and any additional resources that may be of assistance to the family. Navigators make a follow up call approximately two weeks after the initial call to assess referral completion and if any further education or support resources are indicated. In infancy, behavioral targets focus on healthful feeding habits, soothing techniques, age-appropriate sleep and screen time, and developmentally appropriate play and parent engagement. Women and their partners are offered enrollment in the text message campaign during prenatal care or at the child’s 1 month well-child visit. Videos for infancy include topics such as sleep, feeding (breastfeeding, formula, and introduction of solids), hunger and satiety cues, screen time, soothing, and active time for infants. The impact of the First 1000 Days program on prevention of obesity in mother-infant pairs during pregnancy and the first 2 years of infancy is strengthened by its multifactorial, systems-level approach, however these methods also create challenges for program evaluation, as there may be effects both on the entire health center population through changed systems, as well as on individual participants utilizing specific components of the program.
