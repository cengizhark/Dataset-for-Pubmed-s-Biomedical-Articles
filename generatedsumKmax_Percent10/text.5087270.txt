The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) couples cell growth with the availability of biosynthetic inputs such as amino acids (1,2). Crystallization is, after all, a purification method and thus perfectly suited to enrich a small fraction of leucine-bound Sestrin2 in a large background of non-crystallizing apo-Sestrin. Protein production and purificationHuman Sestrin2 was expressed and purified as described previously (6). After washing of the beads with lysis buffer, the protein was eluted in 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 3 mM βME. Briefly, a single 2 µl drop containing crystals of Sestrin2 was diluted into a 50 µl solution of mother liquor (100 mM MES, pH 6.0, 1.2 M disodium malonate, and 1% (v/v) Jeffamine ED 2001), vortexed for 5 minutes in the presence of a polystyrene bead, then diluted again into 500 µl of mother liquor. The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement using our published Sestrin2 structure (PDB ID: 5DJ4) as the search model in the Phaser-MR program, run as part of the Phenix Autosol program (19) (space group I23, 5 molecules per asymmetric unit).
