The fluorescent images were taken right after microsphere fabrication using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200) to avoid the diffusion of fluorescent dyes. The mixture was placed in a 37 °C incubator for gelation. The double stranded DNA (dsDNA) content was measured using a PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher). The constructs were loaded into EPR tubes (n = 3 for each group). The tubes were placed in a hypoxic incubator (1% O2, 37 °C) for 48 h. The EPR tests were performed on an X-band EPR instrument (Bruker), with 0.1 mW for microwave power, 1.0 dB for attenuation, 9.8 GHz for frequency, and 1.5 for modulation amplitude [52]. The tubes were placed in a hypoxic incubator (1% O2, 37 °C) for 48 h. The EPR tests were performed on an X-band EPR instrument (Bruker), with 0.1 mW for microwave power, 1.0 dB for attenuation, 9.8 GHz for frequency, and 1.5 for modulation amplitude [52]. At days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28, the blood perfusion of the normal and surgery hindlimbs was measured using a laser Doppler perfusion imager (Perimed). Cell density was then quantified from the images. Muscle fiber diameter, and density of central nucleus in muscle fibers were quantified based on the H&E images. For immunohistochemical analysis, the tissue sections were first stained with antialpha smooth muscle actin-alpha (α-SMA, Abcam), isolectin (Thermo Fisher), anti-Ki67 (Thermo Fisher), anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC, R&D) and anti-F4/80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The tissue sections were then incubated with corresponding Dylight488-anti mouse and 647-anti rabbit secondary antibodies. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. The PNHAM was made by free radical polymerization of NIPAAm, HEMA, AOLA and NAS (Fig. The molar ratio of the four components was calculated as NIPAAm/HEMA/AOLA/NAS = 52.5/4.4/22.3/20.8 (Fig. PNHAN was conjugated with NIEM via the succinimide-amine reaction (Fig. The conjugation was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrum where the characteristic peak of NAS at 2.8 ppm became unpronounced after conjugation (Fig. The polymer had 30.7% weight loss after 8 weeks in normoxic environment. The ratio of PNHAN and PNHAN/NI18 were modulated to allow the shell to have NI content of 5% and 16%, respectively. The combined effects of water content and degradation rate possibly resulted in accelerated release of oxygen. During the 4-week release study period, the release medium contained less than 10 μM H2O2 as measured by a peroxide assay kit. This hydrogel has been confirmed to be injectable and biocompatible [41,51]. The constructs were cultured under hypoxic condition (1% O2) without supplement of FBS. The blood perfusion in the Surgery group was slowly increased during the 4-week experimental period with 41% blood perfusion at week 4 (Fig. The injection of Gel/MSC and Gel/MSC/ORM promoted skeletal muscle regeneration, as the muscle fiber diameter was significantly increased compared to the Surgery and Gel groups (p < 0.001. Consistent with muscle fiber results, the central nucleus density was remarkably greater in the Gel/MSC/ORM group than other groups (Fig. The reaction was conducted at 80 °C for 4 h followed by overnight stirring at room temperature. The chemical structure of NIEM was confirmed by 1H NMR ((CD3)2SO): δ7.64 (d, 1H), 7.23 (d, 1H), 4.62–4.65 (t, 2H), 3.32–3.35 (t, 2H)). AOLA and NAS were synthesized as previously reported [41,42,51]. The reaction was conducted at 60 °C overnight. After the solvent was evaporated, the product was purified 3 times by dissolving in tetrahydrofuran and precipitating in ethyl ether. The NIEM conjugated polymer was abbreviated as PNHAN/NIx where x represents the ratio of 2-nitroimidazolyl (NI) group. However, these therapeutic approaches are rather invasive, and are not suitable for CLI patients with severe comorbidity or sepsis [5,6]. DPBS was supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) to prevent the growth of bacteria. Blends of PNHAN and PNHAN/NI18 with molar ratio of 0, 3/7 and 9/1 were dissolved in DCM at a concentration of 5 wt%. PVP was dissolved in 30% H2O2.
