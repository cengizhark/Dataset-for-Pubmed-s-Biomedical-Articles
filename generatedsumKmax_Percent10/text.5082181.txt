Preoperative measurements were taken in the operating room, just before surgical correction (range, 7.2 to 15.4 months). Mean forehead width z-scores decreased postoperatively from 0.82 to −0.32 (p = 0.007) (Fig. The estimated effect of bandeau width before fronto-orbital advancement was negligible (0.02 z-score increase per 1 mm). Mean cranial width z-scores decreased postoperatively from 0.9 to 0.2 in the 12 patients for whom both measures were available (p = 0.003). Mean perioperative interdacryon distance was 13.7 ± 1.9 mm (nonsyndromic, 13.7 mm; syndromic, 14.0 mm). There are few published long-term outcomes in patients with corrected metopic synostosis, and most reports rely on subjective evaluation.13,16,18–20 Our results confirm the observations of other authors that frontal width exhibits decreased growth compared with the normal population, leading to bilateral fronto-orbital retrusion and temporal hollowing16 (Fig. A lower number of reoperations and less postoperative temporal hollowing were seen in their patients treated with maximal expansion of the supraorbital bar and stabilization of the construction with strategic bone grafting and resorbable fixation. Anthropometric data were available for only 16 of 34 patients treated by the senior author. The difficulty in identifying the frontotemporale, as noted above, especially in children with craniosynostosis, complicates comparison to other studies using this anthropometric point.
