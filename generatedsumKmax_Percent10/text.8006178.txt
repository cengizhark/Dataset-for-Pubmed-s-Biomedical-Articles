The latter would provide the opportunity for relatively hydrophobic drugs to partition into them, potentially extending the duration of release. In that context, it is worth noting that, for example, bupivacaine has an aromatic group and a tertiary amine. Protonation of the tertiary amine confers water solubility and interaction with anionic surfaces, while the aromatic group imparts the ability to partition into hydrophobic domains of drug delivery systems or biological systems (e.g. Bioadhesion is important to ensure retention at the site of application, improving patient compliance (19). While the fact that there was no tissue reaction whatsoever within the 6h is somewhat reassuring, it cannot preclude the possibility of tissue reaction with more extended exposure. Portions of porcine tissue (epidermis/dermis) were fixed horizontally to the lower end of the analytical probe (P/10) using double-sided adhesive tape and suture, respectively. In TPA mode, the analytical probe descended on the surface of each formulation at a constant rate of 0.5 mm/s, penetrated 10 mm in the formulation and a downward tensile force of 2.45 N was applied at fixated time of 90s. Drug ReleaseThe release of sulforhodamine B, bupivacaine hydrochloride from each formulation was performed using a diffusion system. With topical applications, being able to improve the properties of the hydrogel, such as adhesiveness and viscosity, would make it easier for the formulation to remain in contact with the skin, particularly in places that are relatively difficult to access or with high friction (e.g.
