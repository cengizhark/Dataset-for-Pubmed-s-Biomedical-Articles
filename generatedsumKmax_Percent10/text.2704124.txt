Cell numbers were then measured as described previously [Singha et al , 2007]. This siRNA specifically targets mouse Atf4 mRNA [Adams, 2007; Yu et al , 2008a]. For example, formation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex in early to mid G1 phase activates the kinases that phosphorylate and inactivate the tumor suppressor Rb, a critical step that is necessary for the transition from G1 to S phase [Kato et al , 1994; Sherr, 1994; Zhao et al , 2001]. Cyclin A1 activates CDK2 and is essential at the G1/S boundary and throughout S phase [Pagano et al , 1992]. An ATF/CRE site located in the proximal region of cyclin D1 promoter was reported to bind to CREB and AP1 proteins and mediate active transcription of the gene [Sabbah et al , 1999; Nagata et al , 2001; Datta et al , 2007]. It is also probable that ATF4 activates the cyclin D1 promoter through interactions with CREB and AP1 proteins. The embryonic lens in double homozygous p53/Atf4−/− mice does not undergo apoptosis [Tanaka et al , 1998; Hettmann et al , 2000]. ReagentsTissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan, UT). ATF4 functions as both transcriptional repressor and activator by forming homodimers and heterodimers with members of the AP-1 and C/EBP family of protein, or interacting with many other partners, such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promoter element 1-binding protein, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, NF-E2-related factor 2, c-maf, p300, Zhangfei, factor inhibiting ATF4-mediated transcription, special AT-rich sequence binding protein 2, transcription factor IIAγ, and runt-related transcription factor 2 [Hai and Curran, 1991; Chevray and Nathans, 1992; Nishizawa and Nagata, 1992; Vallejo et al , 1993; Vinson et al , 1993; Motohashi et al , 1997; Reddy et al , 1997; He et al , 2001; Lassot et al , 2005; Xiao et al , 2005; Yu et al , 2005, 2008b; Dobreva et al , 2006; Hogan et al , 2006]. Other reagents were obtained from the following sources: Antibodies against cyclins D1, D3, p21, p27, CDK2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or goat IgG from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody against (β-actin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), BrdU immunostaining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) from Invitrogen, ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cell Cultures and Isolation of Primary BMSCsMouse MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) preosteoblasts were described previously [Xiao et al , 1997; Wang et al , 1999] and maintained in ascorbic acid-free alpha-modified Eagle's medium (alpha-MEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (proliferation medium). MTS AssayMTS assay was described previously [Singha et al , 2007]. After sacrifice, 10-μm sections of calvariae were obtained as described previously [Demiralp et al , 2002]. The levels of mRNA were calculated by the ΔCT (the difference between the threshold cycles) method [Wang et al , 2004].
