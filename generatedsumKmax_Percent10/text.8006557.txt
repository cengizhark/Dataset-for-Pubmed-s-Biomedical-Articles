Moreover, autoregulation of RBF and GFR was impaired in A1 receptor deficient mice (Hashimoto et al  2006), suggesting that this impairment of renal autoregulation may reflect an abolished TGF mechanism. That work suggests that lack of efficient autoregulatory control renders glomeruli susceptible to hyperfiltration and hypertensive kidney injury putting the host at high risk for kidney failure, particularly in African-Americans with hypertension (Palmer 2004). Work in recent decades shows that renal autoregulatory capability is impaired in hypertensive animal models including Ang II, Goldblatt (2K-1C), deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt, the 5/6 renal mass reduction, Fawn-hooded rats and Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats (Ploth et al  1981, Karlsen et al  1997, Griffin et al  2004, Burke et al  2013, Guan et al  2013, 2016). The Dahl SS rat is a well-characterized hypertensive model, which rapidly develops hypertension and glomerular injury upon high salt (HS) diet feeding. The SS rats receiving a low salt diet exhibited normal autoregulatory reactivity which was lost if the HS diet was given. 2), suggesting that inflammation also impairs P2X1 receptor signaling but has no detectable impact on A1 and P2Y2 receptor activation in afferent arterioles of hypertensive rats (Inscho et al  2011, Guan et al  2016). Acute P2 receptor blockade with intra-aortic infusion of PPADS or the P2X1 receptor antagonist, NF449, restored afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance and single nephron GFR to normal in Ang II-infused rats without changes in mean arterial pressure (Franco et al  2011, 2017). P2X7 receptor blockade with the specific antagonist AZ11657312 increased medullary blood flow, improved pressure-natriuresis and reduced glomerular macrophage infiltration via a NO-dependent mechanism (Menzies et al  2015a), suggesting that activation of P2X7 receptor signaling by Ang II induces renal microvascular dysfunction and inflammation. Indirect evidence can be obtained using fiber-optic or needle probes to determine relative regional RBF measured by dual-channel laser Doppler flowmetry (Roman and Smits 1986). The myogenic response operates at a frequency of 0.1–0.2 Hz and occurs at approximately 5 s after a rapid increase in arterial pressure, while TGF operates at a frequency of 0.02–0.04 Hz and appears at approximately 25 s after a rapid increase in arterial pressure (Just and Arendshorst 2003). Since development of the in vitro blood-perfused juxtaglomerular nephron (JMN) technique (Casellas and Navar 1984), we and others applied this approach to study renal autoregulation and renal microvascular reactivity in a variety of rat and mouse models (Navar 1978, Inscho et al  1990, 2004a, Carmines et al  1992, Takenaka et al  1994, Guan et al  2009, Sorensen et al  2012, Nagasawa and Imig 2013). Indeed, the myogenic response was unaffected by amiloride, and actually enhanced by benzamil (Wang et al  2008).ENaC protein and mRNA expression were detected in renal microvessels and freshly isolated preglomerular microvascular smooth muscle cells (MVSMC) from mice and rats (Jernigan and Drummond 2005, 2006, Guan et al  2009). They observed an immediate increase of cortical tissue ATP levels when perfusion pressure was increased, consistent with Nishiyama’s observations in canine kidneys.
