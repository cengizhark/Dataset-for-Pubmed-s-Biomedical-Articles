Notably, no products derived from C–H functionalization of the methyl groups of the fluoroamide directing group were observed in this reaction. Notably, the Ag additive mediates this transformation, and aminal 5 was obtained in 41% yield in the absence of Pd (entry 4). Overall, a 52% overall yield is obtained for the three relevant steps converting 2 to 6 (81% for installation of the directing group, 80% for C–H arylation with 4-iodobiphenyl, and 80% for removal of the directing group; Fig. The C–H arylation of 13 with 4-iodo-o-xylene was conducted on scales ranging from 77 mg to 2.5 g of substrate, with nearly identical yields of 14e (43% and 38% isolated yield, respectively). 1C) via nitrogen-directed transannular C–H activation. We envisioned that coordination of the nitrogen of an alicyclic amine such as piperidine to palladium could enable selective transannular C–H activation17, 18 to generate a bicyclo[2.2.1]palladacycle (exemplified by 1 in Fig.
