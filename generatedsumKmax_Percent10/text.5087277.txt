Fractions containing protein were pooled and desalted into column buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol) using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). This result is consistent with experiments that show that different subunits in the ClpX hexamer bind ATP with a range of affinities.8 ClpXP complexes transferred into buffer with a 7:1 mixture of ADP:ATP (2 mM total) were ~100-fold more kinetically stable than those transferred into ADP alone (Figure 4e), suggesting that complexes containing a mixture of ADP-bound and ATP-bound ClpX subunits are quite stable.In ClpP-free buffer containing 2 mM ATP, little dissociation of ClpXP complexes was observed over 1000 s when the biosensor was washed twice with fresh buffer, moved into buffer containing non-biotinylated sc6ClpXΔN to prevent rebinding of dissociated ClpP, or transferred into buffer containing the GFP-ssrA substrate (Figure 4f). Substantially longer BLI experiments were not possible because of sample evaporation. Substantially longer BLI experiments were not possible because of sample evaporation. However, based on differences in affinity, the free energy of ClpP binding by our single-chain ClpX hexamer is far more favorable than ADEP-2B binding.28 Thus, it is unlikely that one ADEP-binding event would be thermodynamically capable of driving the ClpXP complex into a conformation that forces rapid ClpX dissociation.Our results support a “dynamic competition” model in which one ClpX IGF loop transiently unbinds a ClpP cleft, allowing an ADEP to bind and accelerate dissociation by preventing rebinding of the undocked loop (Figure 6b). Additional mechanistic implicationsIGF-loop flexibility was initially proposed to allow ClpXP docking despite the symmetry mismatch between six loops in the ClpX hexamer and seven clefts in a ClpP ring.17 Consistent with some flexibility, the IGF loops are proteolytically accessible in free ClpX and disordered in crystal structures of ClpX ring hexamers.7,18,29 If these loops are truly flexible, however, then why is ATP or ATPγS required for detectable binding of ClpX to ClpP? All AAA+ proteolytic machines must cycle through a variety of nucleotide-dependent conformations as they mechanically unfold and translocate protein substrates. As a consequence, we suspect that the interactions that stabilize these proteolytic machines will also be highly dynamic and influence their mechanisms of assembly and disassembly.
