Finally, hair measures provide a cumulative measure of exposure (over 6 weeks in this study), but cannot assess gradations of recent or intermittent use. In this analysis, we define subgroups of individuals in the iPrEx open label extension (OLE) study15 - a cohort of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and transgender women on PrEP who were former participants of PrEP trials and then enrolled into iPrEx OLE - with varying risks of renal decline. Prior studies by our group have shown a linear relationship between oral TDF dose and concentrations of TFV in hair16. Of the participants offered hair sampling in iPrEx OLE (324), 68% agreed to hair collection. Of 1224 participants (7475 person-visits) who received PrEP in iPrEx OLE with renal data available (only 1 with missing data), 220 were in the hair substudy (1114 person-visits). The median self-reported adherence in the visits where no drug was detected was 73% (Table 1). The median self-reported adherence in the visits where no drug was detected was 73% (Table 1). adherence or drug-taking), but also monitor pharmacokinetic variability in drug concentrations, serving as a direct assessment of exposure, either short or long-term, depending on the matrix. For example, plasma measures of drug assess exposure over days, whereas drug concentrations in PBMCs assess exposure over weeks26. The relatively short duration of follow-up for this study is a limitation when extrapolating findings to the real-world roll-out of PrEP. Even though entrance to the open-label extension phase did not require normal renal function, this original limitation still restricts generalizability.
