NCI+ status was associated with African American race, eGRF > 60 ml/min, lack of alcohol use, higher hemoglobin level, and lower albumin levels. The FA of the right tapetum was significantly lower in the NCI+ group compared with the NCI− group. Six GM regions in the left hemisphere and nine in the right hemisphere were selected. In unsupervised machine learning, characterized by clustering, algorithms seek to learn structure in the data without the benefit of labels (e.g., diagnoses). This analysis included people who were 18–55 years old. As part of the original protocols, participants were excluded for 2 or more days of use of any illicit drug other than cocaine and marijuana. T-scores for each test were converted to a deficit score ranging from 0 to 5 with 0 representing no impairment and 5 representing severe impairment (Carey et al  2004). Protocol 1 used parameters: b-factor = 900 s/mm2, TR/TE = 10,000/83.2 ms, 73 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 2 used parameters: b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/77.9 ms and 78.2 ms, 67 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 3 used parameters b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/78.6 ms, 67 slices, 80 directions. Protocol 1 used parameters: b-factor = 900 s/mm2, TR/TE = 10,000/83.2 ms, 73 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 2 used parameters: b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/77.9 ms and 78.2 ms, 67 slices, 30 directions; Protocol 3 used parameters b-factor = 800 s/mm2, TR/TE = 8,000/78.6 ms, 67 slices, 80 directions. Anatomical data were analyzed with FSL-VBM (Douaud et al  2007, http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM), an optimized VBM protocol (Good et al  2001) carried out with FSL tools (Smith et al  2004). GM images were then segmented into regions using the Havard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases within FSL. The averaged GM volume within each segmented cortical and subcortical region was then extracted using fslmeants (Jenkinson et al  2012).For the DWI data, all cases were run through a denoising procedure that substantially improves signal quality by reducing non-Gaussian noise-induced signal bias while maintaining anatomic resolvability (Chen et al  2018). First, B1 bias-correction was performed to correct for field inhomogeneity using dwibiascorrect in MRtrix3 and the ANTS N4 method for estimating the bias field (Tustison et al  2010). White matter (WM) images were then segmented into regions using the ICBM-DTI-81 WM label atlas within FSL. The averaged WM volume within each segmented tract was then extracted using fslmeants (Jenkinson et al  2012). In addition to requiring specialized training, neuropsychological testing batteries are relatively time-consuming to implement, language- and education-dependent, and susceptible to contextual influences (e.g., sleepiness, effort level, time of day) (Benloucif et al  2004; Seelye et al  2015). Modeling was also performed using other kernels with no improvement of classification (Appendix Table 1). Sample characteristicsThe characteristics of the 101 participants are summarized in Table 1.
