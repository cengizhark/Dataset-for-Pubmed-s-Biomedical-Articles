Because members of the MAPK family (e.g. Compared to the control plugs, which showed some EC invasion but only minimal vessel formation, FGF2-containing matrigel was characterized by intense EC invasion and vessel formation. Strong nuclear labeling of vascular ECs with an antibody to STAT5A was seen in 10 of these 35 tumors, contrasting with 2 out of 36 nonneoplastic tissues (P=0.012) (Fig. We were unable to detect any labeling with the phospho-specific STAT5 antibody in the small tumor samples present in the array slides. STAT1 is specifically activated in chondrocytes of thanatophoric dysplasia patients, which carry a constitutively active mutant of FGFR3 (15). Src and Jak2 inhibitors block FGF2 and FGF8b-induced tube formationThe effect of Src and Jak2 inhibition on EC tube formation was examined to further explore the role of these tyrosine kinases in STAT5 signaling. For example, a constitutively active mutant FGFR3, which is responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia type II dwarfism, specifically activates STAT1, resulting in chondrocyte growth arrest (15). Similar to our findings in ECs, Maciag’s group (20) attributed FGF1-induced fibroblast migration to Src activation, whereas mitogenesis was associated with the ERK1/2 pathway. Antibodies against Flag (F-3165) and β-actin (AC-74) were from Sigma (www.sigmaaldrich.com). Adenoviral plasmidsA constitutively active STAT5A mutant (STAT5A-CA) harboring a COOH-terminus Flag tag (pRKmSTAT5AHSFlag; generated from pRKmSTAT5AcFlag using site-directed mutagenesis by substituting His299 and Ser711 with arginine and phenylalanine, respectively) and a dominant-negative STAT5A mutant (STAT5A-DN) truncated from amino acid 713 to 793 (pRKmSTAT5A713Flag) were obtained from Steven J. Collins [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, 6 WA; (24, 25)]. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay and the lysates were mixed with 5x sample buffer. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked and incubated with antibodies against the phosphorylated proteins in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk plus 0.5% Tween 20, overnight at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay and 1000 µg of cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with pre-conjugated anti-STAT5A-PAA beads for 6–12 hrs at 4°C. Antibody complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, then mixed with 2x sample buffer and boiled for 10 minutes. FGFs signal via four known receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4). Preparation of nuclear fractionsAfter treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into fresh PBS. The cells were washed rapidly once with hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 10mM KCl; 0.2mM PMSF; 0.5mM DTT) and the supernatant discarded. The nuclei were then lysed and analyzed for p-STAT1, -3 and -5 as described for immunoblots. Briefly, a 12-well tissue culture plate was pre-chilled at −20°C and carefully coated with growth factor-reduced collagen (1.3 µg/ml; 500 µl/well; BD Biosciences, MA). A single scratch wound was introduced in the monolayer using a micropipette tip, and the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with FGF2 or FGF8b at 10 nM. Matrigel for the control group was supplemented with heparin, only.
