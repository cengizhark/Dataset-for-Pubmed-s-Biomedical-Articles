Plasmodium-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells have also been generated, but the MHC class II-restricted TCR is specific for a blood stage antigen (MSP-1) and the epitope is only expressed by P. chabaudi rodent parasites [28–30]. More recently, Heath and colleagues developed a new TCR Tg mouse line bearing CD8 T cells responsive to an antigen expressed during both blood and liver stage [31]. (2) endogenous T cell responses can be studied without knowledge of specific Plasmodium antigens/epitopes or MHC class I or MHC class II restriction elements; and (3) any combination of inbred or outbred mouse strains and Plasmodium parasite species can be studied. Of note, methods for immunizing rodents with live attenuated Plasmodium parasite vaccine platforms have been previously covered [46,47], so our chapter will only describe methods for examining T cell responses induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination. The surface antigen antibody cocktail should include anti-mouse-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2), anti-mouse-CD8α, anti-mouse-CD11a, anti-mouse-CD4, anti-mouse-CD49d, anti-mouse CD90 and cell viability dye.Mix with pipetting and incubate the plate at 4°C for 20–30 min.Wash away unbound antibody and/or tetramer from wells by adding 150 μl of FACS buffer directly to wells containing staining cocktail, spin plate at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Decant or aspirate supernatants, lightly vortex plate, add 100 μl of Cytofix and incubate at 4°C for 7–10 min (see Note 16).Wash away Cytofix from cells by adding 150 μl of FACS buffer directly to wells containing 100 μl of fixative, spin plate at 3–400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Decant or aspirate supernatants, lightly vortex, suspend cells in 180–200 μl of FACS buffer, then store cells at 4°C protected from light until run on the flow cytometer.3.1.2 Measuring responses in spleen or lymph node tissueThis section describes the isolation and flow cytometric staining of lymphocytes recovered from secondary lymphoid tissues of mice immunized with pre-erythrocytic vaccines.Harvest desired secondary lymphoid tissues using sterile scissors and forceps and place tissue into 15 mL conical containing 3 mL of RPMI-1640 medium.Transfer the tissue and medium onto a fine mesh steel screen in a 15 × 60 mm (or 10 × 35 mm) tissue culture dish.
