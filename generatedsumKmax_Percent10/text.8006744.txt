In this study, we have demonstrated a novel and pivotal role of LPCAT3 in adipocyte PC remodeling and provide evidence that polyunsaturated phospholipids, PC in particular, are involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby influencing pre-adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis. One of the key finding in current study is LPCAT3 is also a major isoform in the adipose tissue. Based on our previous work, we have already known LPCAT3, a major isoform in the small intestine and liver, plays an important role in the membrane structure and function of enterocytes and hepatocytes [12, 13]. In mammalian cells, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) are the main regulators of adipogenesis and have been shown to have a broad overlap in their downstream targets [32]. Identifying key factors that control adipocyte differentiation is important for understanding adipose tissue biology and pathology. Wnt ligands can bind to low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) co-receptors and frizzled receptors. The organic phase was air dried and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) as the solvent. Size area of lipid droplets in pictures was quantified by Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA followed by Quantitative real-time PCR performed on a Bio-Rad CFX manager version 3.1. The composition of polyunsaturated PCs in the plasma membrane is regulated by LPCATs [9–11]. After washed by TBST for at least three times filters were again incubated with species-specific secondary antibody such as goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG for 3 hours at room temperature. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA for independent or correlated values followed by Students’ t test.
