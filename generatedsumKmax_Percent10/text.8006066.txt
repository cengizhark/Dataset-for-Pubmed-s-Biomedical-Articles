For conference abstracts, we searched for full text articles and additional reported outcomes in MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the clinicaltrials.gov database. Two team members (SR/DC) independently reviewed the full text of articles, and discrepancies in inclusion/exclusion were resolved by discussion. We identified 2942 unique titles and abstracts and assessed 838 full text manuscripts for eligibility (Figure 1). The full texts were excluded because 690 did not meet our study approach criteria by not including open-ended questions as part of their qualitative approach or by not using qualitative methods. Study outcomeInternationally, patient-reported barriers to asthma medication adherence are diverse. In this scoping review of 47 studies conducted among 12 nations, we found that study participants reported a wide range of barriers to asthma medications adherence, and that the prevalence of barriers reported appeared to differ according to the presence of universal health care and gross national income. We conducted a scoping literature review to identify adult asthma patientâ€“reported barriers to asthma medication adherence among countries with varied economic wealth and universal health care policies. Literature search strategyWe designed our search strategy to be inclusive as possible of published and nonpublished investigations.
