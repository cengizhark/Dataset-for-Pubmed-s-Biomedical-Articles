Identical changes in pathways consistent with EG were detectable in all human cohorts and were limited to an early post-BCG time point. 1A and data file S1). Briefly, CS was obtained from adult (aged 6 to 12 weeks) male caeca and resuspended in dextrose 5% water (D5W; Baxter, JB0081) at a concentration of 160 mg CS/ml D5W and then passed through a 70-μm filter (Falcon, 352350). This strategy allowed for injection volumes and dosages of LPS to be similar between litters that varied in weight. Humane end point was determined using righting reflex and mobility, as previously described (29). Tissues from multiple age-matched and sex-matched donors were combined into a single 70-μm cell strainer, gently dissociated through the filter using the plunger of a 1-ml syringe, centrifuged for 5 min at 470g, and counted using an automated cell counter and dye (Nexcelom Bioscience Cellometer Auto 2000, ViaStain CS2-0106). S4: (i) adoptive transfer of the heterogeneous whole-spleen compartment, (ii) depletion of mature neutrophils via biotin anti-Ly6G and magnetic anti-biotin separation (Miltenyi, 130-107-911 and 130-097-046), or (iii) neutrophil purification by negative magnetic selection (Miltenyi, 130-097-658). An aliquot of each purification or depletion sample was assessed by flow cytometry using the neutrophil markers CD11bpos, Ly6Ghi, Ly6Cint, CD3neg, MHCIIneg, and NK1.1neg, as described (45), to verify purity, which was consistently >95%. Blood was stored on ice for up to 30 min and centrifuged with soft brake at 650g for 10 min. The panel detected the following 47 analytes: B cell activating factor (BAFF), betacellulin (BTC), epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78), Eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, growth-regulated oncogene-α (GRO-α), interferon-α (IFN-α), IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-19, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-22, IL-23, IL-25, IL-27, IL-28, IL-2RA, IL-3, IL-31, IL-33, IL-33R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL7-RA, IL-9, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), Leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, M-CSF, macrophage inflammatory protein-α (MIP-1α), MIP-1β, MIP-2, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The probes used for Cebp-β and Cebp-α were designed with a 5′FAM and a 3′QSY quencher to be run in duplex with the housekeeping gene, but in separate wells from each other. First, the whole-spleen cells were homogenized and resuspended in dPBS mixed with viability dye and anti-CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2; BD, 563006). Hematoxylin and eosin and Ly6G staining was performed on separate but serial sections, and scoring by trained pathologists was performed blinded to treatment group and to study hypotheses. All studies were approved by the University of British Columbia ethics board (protocol nos. Aliquots (200 μl) were immediately placed into 1.3 ml of RNAlater (Invitrogen, AM7020) and stored at −80°C within 3 hours of blood draw until further analysis. Samples were subsequently ground transported to the Medical Research Council (Gambia) on dry ice by the study personnel and then to the UBC (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) under temperature-controlled and monitored conditions (World Courier). Whole blood was centrifuged on site at 500g for 10 min at RT, and plasma was removed. Normalized neutrophil counts were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated samples separately for each postvaccination DOL using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RNA-seq profiling of human-EPIC whole-blood RNATotal RNA was extracted from each sample, and strand-specific cDNA libraries were generated from poly-adenylated RNA, as previously described (34). We then searched the Broad Institute’s Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) immunologic gene set collection (C7) (54) for signatures of growth factor–induced changes in neutrophils, indicating possible EG signatures, and found six such gene sets: GSE15139_GMCSF_TREATED_VS_UNTREATED_NEUTROPHILS_DN, GSE15139_GMCSF_TREATED_VS_UNTREATED_NEUTROPHILS_UP, GSE22103_LPS_VS_GMCSF_AND_IFNG_STIM_NEUTROPHIL_DN, GSE22103_LPS_VS_GMCSF_AND_IFNG_STIM_NEUTROPHIL_UP, GSE22103_UN-STIM_VS_GMCSF_AND_IFNG_STIM_NEUTROPHIL_DN, and GSE22103_UNSTIM_VS_GMCSF_AND_IFNG_STIM_NEUTROPHIL_UP.Gene sets corresponding to up- and down-regulated gene lists for equivalent perturbation experiments were combined. Differences were considered significant with P < 0.05, and exact P values or different thresholds of P values were presented in each figure legend. Representative flow cytometry plots of BCG-induced increase in total neutrophils and proportional increase in mature neutrophils.Fig. To directly examine the role of mature neutrophils, we used both neutrophil depletion (positive selection of mature neutrophils via magnetic antibody labeling of Ly6G+ cells) and purification (negative selection of mature neutrophils via magnetic antibody labeling of all other cells) to determine whether the BCG-induced increase in neutrophils was necessary and/or sufficient to provide the observed protection (adoptive transfer strategy in fig. S5A), yet transfer of purified mature neutrophils did (Fig. Furthermore, scaling up the number of mature control neutrophils to match the number present in a BCG-vaccinated donor spleen or, conversely, scaling down the number of neutrophils in a BCG-vaccinated donor spleen to match the number present in the control donor spleens, provided the same degree of protection (Fig. 3F, with flow cytometry gating strategy shown in fig.
