They are characterized by subacute onset of painful sensations in the legs, progressing over days to weeks to unremitting burning dysesthesias and allodynia [1, 9], with occasional spread to proximal sites involving the trunk or more diffusely [2••, 85]. These neuropathies involve small nerve fibers that are not evaluated by conventional neurophysiological studies [85, 86], and documentation of an SFN requires additional testing, including measures of thermal thresholds, R-R variation, sweat production, orthostatic blood pressure, and skin biopsy [87]. Weight loss usually precedes the onset of severe burning pain and allodynia, but sometimes develops at the onset of pain or even as the pain subsides [1, 2••]. However, robust agreement between clinical and electrophysiological findings, not blind reliance on mild NCS abnormalities, should guide treatment decisions. In a second study, instructions to base clinical diagnoses on unequivocally abnormal symptoms and signs, while taking age, sex, and physical variables into account, greatly improved proficiency and avoided overreporting of signs [11••]. This approach is not readily available in most medical practices, but more easily applied criteria (e.g., use of one or more abnormal attributes in two separate lower extremity nerves based on the first and the 99th percentile values) also performed well [7••]. The 2009 Toronto Consensus Panel defined SFN [5] to include three categories: possible (length-dependent symptoms and/or signs of small-fiber damage), probable (length-dependent symptoms, clinical signs, and normal sural NCS findings), and definite (fulfilling definition of probable plus abnormal IENFD at the ankle or quantitative thermal threshold at the foot) [5]. These additional mechanisms include increased formation of advanced glycation end products [26, 27], downregulation of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products [28], activation of polyol aldose reductase signaling with accumulation of protein kinase C [24, 29], activation of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase [30], cyclooxygenase 2 activation [31], endothelial dysfunction [26], peroxynitrite and protein nitration [32], and altered function of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump [26, 33], all having direct impact on neuronal activity, mitochondrial function, membrane permeability, and endothelial function. Several atypical DNs have subacute onset (days to weeks), a monophasic or relapsing course, and preferentially involve small sensory and autonomic or motor nerve fibers. DRPN presents subacutely with unilateral or asymmetric proximal pain involving the back, hip, or anterior thigh [7••, 74]. Needle EMG abnormalities involve nerve roots, the plexus, and individual nerves, and autonomic testing confirms the presence of small-fiber involvement. However, efficacy is unproven, and no evidence convincingly supports the use of any immunotherapy treatment [72••, 79].
