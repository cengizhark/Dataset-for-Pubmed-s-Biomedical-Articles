The size of the study population, the duration of the intervention, and the neuropathy assessment used biases and limited conclusions that may be drawn from these trials. Vibration perception threshold (VPT) testing was performed at EDIC year 13–14 [26•, 29]. Loss of protective sensation heightens the risk for foot ulceration and lower extremity amputations, and painful symptoms are frequently refractory to treatment [2, 7]. Clinically evident neuropathy was defined as at least two positive findings among sensory symptoms, signs, or reflex abnormalities consistent with a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy as assessed clinically by a neurologist; abnormal NCSs were defined by the presence of at least one abnormal NCS attribute >2 nerves among the median, peroneal, and sural nerves [11–13, 26•]. Thus, the evaluation of the impact of glucose control on neuropathy outcomes in many large randomized trials is limited by the lack of uniformity of DSP definitions and measures used. CAN was assessed during DCCT at baseline every 2 years and at DCCT-end and in EDIC during years 13–14 and 16–17, using standard cardiovascular reflex testing (CARTs) that included R–R variation to paced breathing (RRV), R–R response to Valsalva maneuver (VR), and postural changes in blood pressure [26•, 27, 40]. These tests are objective, standardized, simple to use, highly reproducible [41, 42], and endorsed by the Toronto Consensus on Diabetic Neuropathies as the gold standard [2, 43]. Participants were questioned about autonomic symptoms at EDIC year 13–14 [27, 41]. EURODIAB queried symptoms and changes in heart rate and blood pressure with standing [39, 44], while the UKPDS assessed R–R intervals with deep breathing and standing [18]. Steno-2 assessed R–R interval during paced breathing and presence of orthostatic-hypotension [23], ADDITION obtained resting heart rate variability and some CARTs, but only at the 6-year follow-up visit. CAN prevalence also increased by EDIC year 13–14 (29 % in the intensive vs. 35 % in the conventional group), with treatment group differences remaining significant [26•, 41]. Although one third of DCCT/EDIC participants had CAN by the 13–14th year of EDIC follow-up, few participants reported autonomic symptoms. Table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of DSP measures used in large observational and randomized glucose control trials.
