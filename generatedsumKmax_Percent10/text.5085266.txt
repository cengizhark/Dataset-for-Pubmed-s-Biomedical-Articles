2), a region located approximately 457â€“293 kb from SSR 20338 in the direction away from CsPPR336. The MSC mutants of cucumber are useful research tools for mitochondrial genetics (Lilly et al  2001; Bartoszewski et al  2004, 2007; Del Valle-Echevarria et al  2015). These MSC mutants possess misshapen cotyledons and chlorotic leaves, and show lower seed germination, slower growth, and poor fertility relative to wild-type plants (Malepszy et al  1996). We focused on Csa3M824840.1 as a likely candidate for Psm because it is a PPR-containing gene annotated as PPR336 in Arabidopsis (At1G61870). The unique transmission modes of the cucumber organelles [maternal for chloroplast and paternal for mitochondria (Havey 1997)] allow for the separation of organellar effects by reciprocal crossing. Havey et al  (2004) made crosses with MSC16 as the male parent to diverse plant introductions (PI) of cucumber and occasionally observed a high proportion of wild-type progenies. A total of 45 SNPs and 340 F2 individuals were selected after eliminating individuals with fewer than 25 (out of 45) SNPs scored, as well as markers that were genotyped on fewer than 100 (out of 349) individuals. A major QTL at position 119 cM (LOD = 40) and a minor QTL at position 131 cM (LOD = 3.1) were above the threshold LOD of 2.6 (Fig. Pockets of repetitive DNAs present in the cucumber mtDNA allow for recombination to produce different conformations even among individual plants of the same cultivar or population (Lilly and Havey 2001; Lilly et al  2001; Alverson et al  2011). An ANOVA performed on the major QTL was significantly (p < 0.0001) associated with percentage of wild-type progeny, explaining 69 % of the variance. Six genes in this region were annotated to have organellar functions, two mitochondrial (Csa3M824840.1 and Csa3M824970.2) and four chloroplast (Csa3M824870.1, Csa3M825000.1, Csa3M825040.1 and Csa5M146950.1) (Supplemental File 3). We disregarded chloroplast-targeted genes because Psm is associated with paternally transmitted mitochondria. Segregation analysis of restriction-site polymorphism in CsPPR336The S220R polymorphism in CsPPR336 results in the loss of a BsaWI restriction site in P3A (Fig. We determined segregations for this BsaWI polymorphism and the phenotypes (MSC versus wild-type) of progenies. For 96 randomly selected wild-type progenies, the presence versus absence of the BsaWI site segregated 54:42, fitting the expected 1:1 ratio (p = 0.221).
