1) performed in our centers strongly argues against this possibility and favors a true drop in practice. In fact, this drop in absolute numbers is even more striking, considering that it progressively decreased over time, even though each one of these surgical centers was becoming more established and gaining in reputation as a referral center.The practice of m-TLE-related surgery is indeed decreasing in major epilepsy centers, but this is merely a reflection of varying referral patterns with “simpler” m-TLE-related surgeries occurring in local hospitals instead. Such an idea is supported by observations already reported in multiple healthcare systems, including on the national level in the United States using the NIS database,7 in the United Kingdom where the number of children receiving surgery for epilepsy had increased annually up to, and declined after, the establishment of Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Service centers,34 and in Germany where an epidemiological analysis of 2,812 patients who had TLE surgery between 1988 and 2008 showed an early increase in the proportion of patients with MTS during the first few years studied, only to subsequently demonstrate an increase in the age and duration of epilepsy in patients with MTS despite stable overall surgical numbers over time interpreted to suggest a reduction in incidence of MTS.17 Implications of findings for future researchWhile debating the causes of our findings is important, it is critical to advance the discussion further and tackle their implications. Regardless of the cause, our data suggest that m-TLE related surgeries no longer account for the major burden of surgical epilepsy in major established epilepsy centers in the developed world, and an increasing number of patients with complex nonlesional epilepsy are being assessed/undergoing surgery.
