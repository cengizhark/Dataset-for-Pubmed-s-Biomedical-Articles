2C); the average half-width of the uEPSCs was 2.53 ± 1.74 ms with a median of 2.06 ms, (Fig. 3A responded to paired pulse inputs with depression (blue points in Fig. 4C), the data for uEPSC peak amplitude vs. latency is best fit by a logarithmic decay function (y = −0.32 * log(x) + 0.982; p < 0.01). The three different models were statistically compared (see Materials and Methods) in order to find out which most adequately explains the data with the minimal assumptions. The quantal model allows extraction of quantal size (in pA) that corresponds to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter; this model was chosen for 30 of 75 cases (40%). 6H) suggesting that the binomial release probability and the overall release probability should correlate, as is the case (R2 = 0.59; p <0.01 Fig. Slice preparationAll experiments were performed according to guidelines by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine and followed the NIH Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Coronal slices of the visual cortex were cut at 300 μm with a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). Coronal slices of the visual cortex were cut at 300 μm with a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). Neurons were visualized with a Zeiss upright microscope (Axioskope FS1; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an Achroplan 40x 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion lens set up for Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.Glass micropipettes (Corning 7056 glass; 1.5 OD, 1.12 ID; A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) were pulled on a vertical puller (PP-830; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to an open tip resistance of 2.5−4.0 MΩ and filled with a pipette solution containing (in mM) 115 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 4 phosphocreatine-Na, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 by KOH. Thus, probabilities across release sites may not always be uniform, perhaps due to differences in presynaptic densities or readily releasable pools (Harris and Sultan, 1995), vesicle fusion machinery (Augustin et al , 1999; Rosenmund et al , 2002; Yang et al , 2002), or activity histories.Our anatomical (n=9) and quantal analysis (n=75) estimates for the average number of release sites agree with each other (4.11±4.56 and 4.29±2.02, respectively) and are close to previous estimates for L4 connections to other L4 (6.6±2.1 – Cowan and Stricker, 2004; 3.4±1.0 - Feldmeyer et al , 1999) and to L2/3 (4.5±0.5 - Feldmeyer et al , 2002; 5.1±0.9 - Silver et al , 2003) cells, although our results suggest that the range of N might be greater than previously thought (Fig. This is in contrast with previous estimates of release probabilities at individual L4-L4 sites (rat S1, average Pr=79±2% – Silver et al , 2003; cat V1 range of Pr=68−98% - Tarczy-Hornoch et al , 1999). It is unlikely that late development of spiny stellates was a factor because we used guinea pigs (which are more precocious than other rodents - Rice et al , 1985) in their second postnatal week, when spiny stellates are abundant within L4 in other preparations such as rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al , 1999; Schubert et al , 2003; Feldmeyer et al , 2005). All the putative anatomical synaptic contacts that we observed were located on proximal basilar dendrites (distance range = 33−151 μm from the soma; n=9 connected pairs). Such putative contacts are often anatomically verifiable synapses (93% - Silver et al , 2003; 86% - Lubke et al , 2003) although other studies suggest the proportion may be much smaller (32%; DaCosta and Martin, 2007). Excitatory L4 neurons in guinea pig V1 have ∼2500 spines (see Results). Cells with membrane potentials more positive than −60 mV and recordings with high access resistance (>40 MΩ or >20% the value of the input resistance for that cell) were discarded. We chose to record the unitary synaptic currents under voltage clamp (vs. recording synaptic potentials under current clamp) for better signal to noise and detection of small events for quantal analysis. Intracortical information processing has serial and parallel components (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Gilbert, 1983, 1993; Callaway, 1998; Martin, 2002; Thomson and Bannister, 2003), through vertical interlaminar and horizontal intralaminar projections (Lund et al , 1979; Ahmed et al , 1994; Lubke et al , 2000). Analyses were performed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and R 2.71 (R Development Core Team; Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A full account of the analysis methods used in this study has been described in others’ studies (Stricker and Redman, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004). This initial fit was the unconstrained model, since no restrictions were imposed on the locations or weights of the peaks. Once this optimal K was obtained, a quantal model (in which the peaks are forced to be equally distanced by a separation q, corresponding to the quantal content of a synaptic vesicle) was fit to the uEPSC PDF and compared to the unconstrained model. In this way, every analyzed synaptic connection was assigned to one of three models (unconstrained, quantal or binomial) and a different number of synaptic parameters were extracted depending on the model: number of peaks, failure rate, quantal size q (for quantal and binomial connections) and release probability p (for binomial connections).
