Found C, 62.20; H, 5.40; N, 10.06.Continued elution gave the β-linked derivative 11b as colorless syrup 11.3 g, 9.2%. HRMS (ESI-TOF): m/z [M+Na]+ calcd for C22H25O4N3SNa 450.1463, found 450.1459.Continued elution gave the β-linked glycoside 7b as colorless syrup (2.1 g, 1.8%, Total 99.4 g, 86% overall, α/β ∼ 46:1). Red color developed immediately and, after 20 min, when TLC (Solvent 1, Rf = 0.72 at 4:1 hexane–EtOAc. The residue was chromatographed (10:1 hexane– EtOAc) and title compound 14 was obtained as colorless syrup (47.9 g, 94%), [α]D +23.8 (c 1.0, CHCl3). TMSOTf (4.7 mL, 26.1 mmol) was added, whereupon red color developed immediately. An additional advantage of the approach described here is that the stereoselectivity of the critical glycosylation reaction, which converted the terminal determinant to a conjugation-ready form, was substantially increased by controlling it thermodynamically.2, 6 The crude product was passed through a short pad of silica and elution with 5:1 hexane–EA afforded pure 4 as white solid. HRMS analysis of the crude product confirmed formation of the desired coupling product only (HRMS (ESI-TOF): m/z [M+H+] calcd for C131H177O49N6Si 2646.1312; found 2646.1313),. The organic phase was dried, concentrated, and chromatography (DCM–MeOH–Py 10:1:0.1) gave pure 19 as colorless syrup (738 mg, 84% over 2 steps), [α]D −11.6 (c 1.0, CHCl3), 1H NMR (600 MHz, CD3OD): δ 7.45–7.41 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 7.39–7.37 (m, 6H, Ar-H), 7.36–7.32 (m, 6H, Ar-H), 7.31–7.25 (m, 10H, Ar-H), 7.25–7.18 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 5.40 (t, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2VI), 5.10–5.00 (m, 10H, 6× H-2′, H-1II, H-1III, H-1IV, H-1V), 4.77 (s, 1H, H-1I), 4.65–4.55 (m, 12H, 11× CH2Ph and H-1VI at 4.56), 4.41 (d, 1H, J = 11.3 Hz, CH2Ph), 4.21–4.03 (m, 22H, 12× H-4′, 6× H-4I-VI, 4× H-2II-V), 3.98–3.91 (m, 6H, 6× H-3I-VI), 3.88–3.76 (m, 7H, H-2I, 5× H-5, OCHaCH2Si), 3.71 (m, 1H, H-5), 4.48 (m, 1H, OCHbCH2Si), 2.15–1.98 (m, 51H, 6× Ha,b-3′ incl. The material was sufficiently pure for the next step.Method 1:To a solution of the hexasaccharide trichloroacetimidate donor 21 (100 mg, 0.04 mmol) and glycosyl acceptor 22 (35 mg, 0.2 mmol) in dry DCM (7 mL) was added 0.1 g of 4 Å powdered molecular sieves, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Chromatography (3:2 toluene–acetone) gave first the α-linked hexasaccharide (2a, 132 mg, 66%) as colorless syrup. Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. Given the limited number of free hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding, the majority of the intermolecular interactions will be weaker non-polar van der Waals type interactions. In this case, the conformations of the polysaccharide chains of the two independent molecules are more likely to reflect a conformational energy minimum for the chain, then would be the case if extensive hydrogen bonding were present. That the predominant isomer contained the desired α-configuration followed from the 13C-1H coupling constant for the 13C carbon involved in the newly formed interglycosidic linkage. In most situations across carbohydrate chemistry, synthesis of the 1,2-trans-glycosidic linkage is not problematic because a participating group can be introduced into 2-positions of the glycosyl donors. One of our major targets has been a conjugate vaccine for cholera from synthetic fragments of O-SPs of Vibrio cholerae.1–3 Intermediates to oligosaccharides in this series, up to and including the hexasaccharide have been successfully prepared on multigram scales.

Chemical shifts were referenced to that of tetramethylsilane (0 ppm) or signals of residual non-deuterated solvents. The data were processed using the Bruker APEX III software package. The crystal structure was solved and refined using the SHELXL21 software package.
