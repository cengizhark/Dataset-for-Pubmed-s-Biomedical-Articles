Advances in imaging modalities have improved our ability to diagnose anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries and describe differences in anatomic features that may or may not be associated with increased risk of ischemia in this population. Study LimitationsAs discussed above, there is no gold standard test which correlates with higher risk of death and presumably with induced ischemia in AAORCA, and hence, validating TPScR as a risk stratification tool is challenging without longer term follow-up data. This study confirms previous reports that exercise-induced regional WMA are uncommon in these patients; however, it suggests TPScR may be an indicator of higher risk for ischemia. Echocardiographic images were obtained using GE Vivid E95 ultrasound machines (GE Health Medical). Echocardiographic B-mode images were obtained from the apical four-chamber, two-chamber, and long-axis views, and parasternal long- and short-axes views at baseline and immediately after termination of exercise. Regional wall motion was assessed by visual inspection by a single attending pediatric cardiologist with experience in reading ESEs (W.R.T.). Analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (Foundation for Statistical Computing) and Stata software (StataCorp). Exercise stress echocardiography in adults with CAD has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 88% and 83% to 86%, respectively, to detect coronary luminal stenosis of at least 50%, which is considered the minimum degree of stenosis necessary to cause exercise-induced regional WMA observable by visual inspection.11 The gold standard test for determining the degree of coronary stenosis is angiography. Because of this lack of a gold standard surrogate endpoint, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of stress imaging in this condition are unknown, and therefore, the results are necessarily difficult to interpret and use to guide decision making, whether positive or negative.
