The human hippocampus is among the most well-studied structures in the brain because of its important functional role in memory processing and learning, its remarkable neuronal cell plasticity, and its involvement in epilepsy and neurodegenerative disease processes. Recently, small field of view (FOV) in vitro studies have defined the imaging appearance of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture using high-field MR at 3T (9), 7T (10), 8T (11), and at 9.4T (12). RF power was also limited by the scanner's power monitoring unit to 10W averaged over 30 seconds corresponding to â‰ˆ1.6 W/kg head specific absorption rate (SAR) (roughly one-half the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] limit). One example showing filtered phase images and enhanced SWI magnitude images is presented for comparison. These veins are shown to be in direct continuity with the C-shaped band of low signal on both the T2*W 2D FFE and SWI sequences, so they also may contribute to imaging characteristics of this region at lower field strength.Data from the thin slice SWI can be reconstructed using minIPs to visualize various venous interconnections. Using very high field MRI (7T) protocol optimization coupled with an understanding of the in vitro hippocampal anatomy improved anatomic clarity of the hippocampal formation's subcomponents and can be exploited to better understand the imaging appearance at routine clinical field strength. Therefore, RF power deposition can vary significantly across the brain, leading to miscalibration of the desired flip angle. Finally, SAR levels increase significantly at higher fields.
