These subjects would likely get diagnosed during the follow-up and be misclassified as having LOA. A stronger signal was most likely achieved by decreasing heterogeneity in the phenotype, but this would need to be replicated in a dataset with better information on these comorbidities. Control subjects were those who never reported an asthma diagnosis during any examination.Data from MESA were used to investigate the top SNPs and genes identified in WHI. Asthma has a strong genetic component, and genomewide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified more than 100 asthma genes and loci and shed light on the underlying disease mechanisms.9 However, most studies have focused solely on those with early-onset asthma or grouped together those with early-onset asthma and those with LOA. Quantile-quantile plots based on P values from the genomewide association analysis in WHI are shown in eFigure 2. LOA genetics has been largely understudied, and the mechanisms underlying LOA are not clear.8 Recently, the association between asthma and variants near the HLA complex group 22 gene (HCG22) has been shown to increase with older age of onset in a Japanese population.10 This suggests that the genetic contribution to asthma might differ according to age of onset. No SNP was significantly associated with LOA based on a Bonferroni-corrected P value of 5.78 × 10−8. Quantile-quantile plots based on P values from the genomewide association analysis in MESA are shown in eFigure 3. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) observational cohort and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were used to identify subjects with LOA.
