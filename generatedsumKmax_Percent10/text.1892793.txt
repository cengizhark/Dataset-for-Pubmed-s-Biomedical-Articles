Further evidence of PFC noradrenergic modulation of attentional processing comes from the study of working memory (Arnsten et al  1988; Franowicz and Arnsten 1999, for a review, see Arnsten 2004). Effects of systemic guanfacine administrationGuanfacine dose-dependently decreased discriminative accuracy and increased correct latency in NA-depleted animals only [lesion × dose interaction F(2.76,17)=4.24, p=0.012 for accuracy, and F(2.44,17)=7.82, p=0.001 for correct latency, respectively, see Fig. Although NA-depleted animals were significantly quicker to respond correctly than shams under saline control conditions (p=0.035), at the three highest dose levels they were slower to respond both as compared to their own saline control performance (p<0.01 for 0.1,0.3,and 1 mg/kg) and sham-operated control animals at the same dose (p=0.031, p=0.025, p<0.001; p=0.003 for 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg guanfacine, respectively). However, it is possible in certain situations resulting in impaired performance (due to stress or psychopathology) that guanfacine may confer benefits via a behavioral “calming” effect that does indeed depend on baseline state. One to two rats were housed per cage in a reverse light cycle room (lights on 7:00 a.m.). Bilateral microinfusions of vehicle (PBS, pH 7.4) or DβH–saporin (0.02 μg/infusion, 0.5 μl infusion volume) were carried out using 31-gauge, non-beveled stainless steel injectors (Cooper Needle Works, UK) at a rate of 0.17 μl/min commencing 1 min after lowering the injectors in the brain. Animals were given a week to recover from surgery before being retested. A food magazine was situated on the wall opposite the nose-poke apertures. Each session consisted of 100 trials and lasted approximately 30 min. Perseverative responding, defined as repeated responding in any hole during the presentation of the light stimulus or during the limited hold period, was monitored but not punished. Each session was broken down into 10-min time bins. The first high event rate challenge (27–30 days post-surgery) consisted of reducing the fixed intertrial interval to 2 s. The second challenge (36–37 days post-op) employed a short variable ITI schedule in which (instead of the usual fixed 5 s intertrial interval) the ITI varied randomly between 0.5 and 4.5 s (ITI values of 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 s). Histological proceduresAt the conclusion of the behavioral testing, the animals were given a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg ml−1 kg−1, i.p., Euthatal, Vet Drug, Bury St. Edmunds, UK) and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. From the anterior prefrontal cortex to the fimbria fornix (+5.20 to −0.40 mm from bregma) then further at the level of the locus coeruleus (−9.16 to −10.80 mm, every fourth section (40 μm) was collected in PBS. Sections were then rinsed in PBS (3×5 min) followed by a 10-min wash in phosphate nonsaline buffer, mounted onto subbed slides and air-dried overnight. StatisticsSPSS 13 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.All effects were examined using mixed-model ANOVA with a number of different within-subject factors but a constant between subject factor of Lesion (presence or absence of NA depletion). Subcortical structures were spared at all levels (see Table 1). Additionally, visualization of the floor of the fourth ventricle revealed a loss of DβH-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus of lesioned animals compared to shams.
