When tested in compartmented cultures, this dominant inhibitory construct decreases sensory neuronal survival as assessed by an increase in apoptosis (Figure 3E). As shown in Figure 4A, the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-w is upregulated by neurotrophin stimulation of distal axons by NGF+BDNF, NGF alone, or BDNF alone, and not by cell body stimulation. Both bcl-w and mef2d induction require Trk activation, and so are prevented by K252A, an inhibitor of Trk kinase activity; Trk kinase activity is also required for induction of c-fos (Figure 4C). This may include other promoter elements; for example two sites that resemble half of a CRE binding motif are also present in the bcl-w promoter region (−9871 to−9867 and 2048 to 2052, TGACG). These mice are viable, but males are infertile due to apoptosis in the developing testes (Print et al , 1998; Ross et al , 1998). Retinal ganglion cells exhibit increased dendritic arborisation in response to BDNF applied at the axon terminals, while dendritic arborisation is decreased by BDNF stimulation of dendrites within the retina, indicating that the biological response to neurotrophins varies based on location of stimulation (Lom et al , 2002). Each of these features may contribute to the selective induction of retrograde response genes by distal axon stimulation, with little or no induction by cell body or global stimulation. However, in the face of heightened ERK5 activity, as occurs during distal axon stimulation or in response to cell body stimulation following virus infection or other stress signals, activation of ERK5 may override negative effects of ERK1/2 and so lead to retrograde response gene induction. plenti-hU6BX RNAi plasmids and TK-pRL were from Cellogenetics (Baltimore, MD) and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. MEF2D 6066 (1:1000 for Western blot and 1:100 for immunostaining) was developed in the Greenberg lab, and generated by injecting antigen (a fragment of MEF2D protein, amino acids 292-514; see Han et al , 1995) into rabbit. Characterization and specificity of this antibody are shown in Supplemental Figure 2. Tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX for 10 minutes and blocked in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% TritonX for 60 minutes. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in MEF2D 6066 (1:100) followed by incubation in goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1000) for one hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in MEF2D 6066 (1:100) followed by incubation in goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1000) for one hour at room temperature. Neurons were harvested and protein levels of MEF2D were analyzed by Western blot. For in vivo analysis, condensed nuclei using DAPI (1:1000) were counted from post-natal day 0 (P0) bcl-w +/+ or bcl-w −/− animals. These transcription factors are rapidly induced by neurotrophin stimulation of either cell bodies or distal axons, and so are unlikely to be critical for spatially selective responses to neurotrophin stimulation. To determine whether neurotrophin stimulation of mef2d might participate in neurotrophin-dependent survival of sensory neurons, we reduced the level of MEF2D using mef2d RNAi expressed in lentivirus (Figure 2A), and then tested the ability of neurotrophins to promote survival in compartmented cultures.
