Providers from participating clinics received an LG-CC toolkit and training, but were randomized at the clinic level to receive either additional coaching via proactive, regular contacts to address barriers to LG-CC uptake (10) or as-needed technical support. Of the 385 study participants with complete baseline surveys, 139 did not complete the 12-month survey. Of those who completed both surveys, 27 had either missing outcome or covariate data. CCMs are typically implemented by a clinical nurse or social worker (care manager) who provides individual self-management support, coordinates care between providers (care management), completes outcomes assessments, and links patients to specialists in collaboration with the individualâ€™s physician. These individuals may have unmet service needs that require additional management beyond standard care management. Future studies may also require the further intensification of evidence-based Collaborative Care Models for individuals with serious mental illness in order to potentially mitigate critical service encounters and improve outcomes.
