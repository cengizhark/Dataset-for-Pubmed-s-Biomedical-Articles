The cardiomyocyte data support our findings in neurons that telomere shortening can trigger age-related marker expression in cells with no or minimal capacity for cell proliferation.In addition to the aging phenotypes observed, neurons with shortened telomeres also show preliminary evidence for disease specific phenotypes. Our current study represents a proof of concept for the use of telomere shortening as an “induced aging” strategy suitable for iPSC-based disease modeling. were then multiplied by the dilution factor and normalized by the Day 0 (Fig. The media is replaced the next day with RPMI supplemented with B27 and BMP4 (10nM). Flow Cytometry, mtROS and Cycle AnalysesCells were dissociated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) and stained with directly conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences). The primers used are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures section. ImmunostainingCells were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 30 minutes. ImmunostainingCells were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 30 minutes. Cells were stained with primary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA at 4°C overnight, washed and stained with secondary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature, in the dark. The following primary antibodies were used: TH (1:1000; Pel Freeze), FOXA2 (Santa Cruz; 1:200), OCT4 (1:100; Santa Cruz), NANOG (1:50; R&D), and phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139; clone 20E3; 1:400; Cell Signaling). Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) AnalysisCells were harvested by trypsin treatment, washed with PBS, pelleted and frozen at −80°C for genomic DNA collection. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 40mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 40mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C. Based on these results, we used 10μM and 40μM concentration of BIBR1532 for treating hPSCs with DMSO as a control. In the PARKIN line, the 10μM treatment group only increased the percentage of short telomeres, while no decrease in the mean telomere length was observed at this concentration (Fig. We showed that PROGERIN expression induces both general aging-associated phenotypes such as abnormal nuclear morphologies and accumulation of DNA damage and ROS as well as features more specific to neuronal aging such as shorter dendrites. Those data are compatible with the notion that the percentage of short telomeres is a more sensitive parameter than the mean telomere length in individual cells (Hemann et al , 2001; Vera et al , 2012; Vera and Blasco, 2012).
