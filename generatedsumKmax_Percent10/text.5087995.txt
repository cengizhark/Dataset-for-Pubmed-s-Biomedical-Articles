DNA templates for sgRNAs were made using the protocol described by Li et al (Li et al , 2013) using primers listed in Table S1. We note that the T7E1 assay often underestimates the rate of indel formation, potentially due to self-hybridization of the alleles that carry the indel, incomplete duplex melting, and inefficient cleavage of single nucleotide indels (Schumann et al , 2015). We chose to disrupt two polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components Eed and Suz12, which are both found mutated in human leukemias (Shih et al , 2012). Although this approach produces invaluable insights and still remains a gold standard in studying HSC biology, large time- and cost-commitments are required to generate new mouse models, and the approach is generally not amenable to high-throughput studies. Sanger sequencing and TIDE analysis (Brinkman et al , 2014) revealed that approximately 50% of the sequence reads accrued small indels between 4bp deletion and 2bp insertion (Figure S2A, B). Strikingly, all three guides displayed very high efficiencies of disrupting CD45 expression (sg1: 98%, sg2: 91% and sg3: 74%) as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure S3A). As expected for this time point (Goyama et al , 2015; McDermott et al , 2010), engrafted human HSPCs gave rise mainly to B- and myeloid cells in the bone marrow in both Cas9 only and Cas9/hCD45-sg1 RNP engrafted mice, with no differences between these two groups (Figure S4C). These results establish that our method allows for efficient gene disruption of human CD34+ HSPCs while retaining multilineage reconstitution capacity and the ability of these cells to engraft and expand in recipient mice. Thus, we synthesized guide RNA pairs targeting exons 7–14 of DNMT3A. Thus, we synthesized guide RNA pairs targeting exons 7–14 of DNMT3A. Single-stranded oligonucleotide HDR templates (ssODNs) were designed with symmetric or asymmetric homology arms (Richardson et al , 2016) to introduce three basepair changes, two of which result in the generation of a BsiWI site near the hCD45-sg1 spacer sequence (Figure 4F).
