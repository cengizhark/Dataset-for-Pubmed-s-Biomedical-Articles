The ALT level was highest in the histology cohort, reflecting that those with higher ALT levels were more likely to be referred for biopsy. Liver volume and liver stiffness both significantly correlated with BMI (P < .001; Table S2). Patients with a higher BMI had a higher stiffness after controlling for confounders (P < .0001; Table S3).Regarding the histologic cohort, non-Hispanic patients had higher BMI (P = .004; Table S1). BMI significantly correlated with steatosis score (P = .044), but not with the NAS, lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis score (Table S2). The NASH-CRN requires biopsy confirmation of NAFLD for enrollment and therefore may be subject to selection bias for children with more advanced NAFLD. The association of NAFLD severity with severe paediatric obesity extends the field, as pre-existing literature, which had analysed BMI as a continuous variable and had determined disease severity using histology, had not identified an association with higher BMI and liver disease severity.12,13 While ALT is considered an imprecise marker of liver disease severity,24 it is the tool of choice to screen for and monitor the progression of liver disease severity in the clinical setting.9 In our study, participants with class III obesity had higher serum ALT levels and increased odds of an ALT level > 80 U/L compared with participants with less obesity. Although liver stiffness using ultrasound or MR is well validated as a marker of advanced hepatic fibrosis, we did not find significant differences in the fibrosis stage or the frequency of advanced fibrosis by obesity class in the histology cohort.23 However, as MRE samples a greater proportion of the liver compared with biopsy, there may be potential for discordance between liver stiffness and histology due to sampling error, plus the limitation of assessing agreement between a continuous variable (liver stiffness) with categorical histological grading.
