In this paper, we present the engineering aspects of a general methodology tailored to spatiotemporally control mechanical forces inside bioreactors. Oj denotes a measurement (observed value), whereas Tj denotes the corresponding desired measurement (target value). The search algorithm aims to find a solution that is better than the one provided by the MLP, by following a number of rules to introduce changes to the MLP output as shown in the pseudocode below (see Algorithm 1). 5(d)-(f) and 6 (details in the Section III), any inaccuracies produced by the approximation can be compensated for in the second phase where simulations are replaced with real NMR measurements. At the inlets, we set U = Uin according to the input speed determined by the algorithm. F.NMR Shear Rate MeasurementThe pulse sequence for the NMR imaging experiment is shown in Fig. gradients was modified to include phase-contrast velocimetry as in [19] and [20]. gradient with the same magnitude. In this study, velocity measurements represent velocities averaged along the z-direction. In this study, velocity measurements represent velocities averaged along the z-direction. 5(d) shows a uniform pattern. 5(c)] demonstrates that the algorithm converged to a reasonable solution in less than 25 iterations, and found an accurate solution in less than 50 iterations. The results confirm the algorithm’s excellent adaptive abilities. These results also validate the use of a simplified CFD model in the training phase, in order to reduce computational cost and training time. Growth media flowing into the bioreactor was warmed to 37 °C and sparged with a 5% CO2 gas mixture. The algorithm demonstrates high efficiency, as it converges to a solution with a small number of iterations. Inlets are distributed around a chamber that holds a 3-mm-thick scaffold. 1(a) and (b) show the CAD drawings of the bioreactor design. NMR imaging probe. Scaffolds were held in place by two large pore-density filters. The state of the art approach involves creating materials with local porosity gradients [8], [9], [12]-[17]. The state of the art approach involves creating materials with local porosity gradients [8], [9], [12]-[17]. Pressure was measured using Omega DPG8000 pressure gauges. C.Adaptive Control AlgorithmMachine learning methods including artificial neural networks are now commonly used to solve a variety of problems in cell biology [22], [23]. A new shear rate map corresponding to the inlets’ flow speeds generated by the MLP with D inputs is obtained (Oj) and compared to the desired target (Tj) pattern using the cost function ξ1 of
