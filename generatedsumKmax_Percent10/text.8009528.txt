This suggests that the AF spectra of drusen and sub-RPE deposits may be detectable clinically with suitable hyperspectral AF imaging, despite the fact that anatomically thin BLinD is not detectable by IR reflectance on SD-OCT and BLamD is visible only when thick. Drusen are also classified into hard and soft on their imaging appearance. Drusen dimensions were measured on the 40×, 1,390×1,038 dimension images in Photoshop (50 microns = 200 pixel). We previously reported from BrM in normal RPE/BrM flat mounts (11) was not observed in any tissue, but was replaced by SDr as the shortest wavelength spectrum recovered. Two foveal samples were inadequate for hyperspectral AF analysis, and one partially recovered only S1 and S2; all of which had large areas of bare BrM. We have previously observed the longer wavelength spectrum S3 to be more correlated than S1 and S2 with pigmented structures in the RPE, and therefore have (11,12) posited it to be the AF signal from the organelle melanolipofuscin (MLF). It is also worth noting that the spectrum SDr was not observed in any of the 42 tissue locations from 14 normal eyes studied in our previous work (11), suggesting high specificity of SDr for AMD eyes. Also, our study was not powered to investigate regional differences in RPE AF signal that might be ascribable to recently uncovered detailed mapping of autofluorescent granules (31).
