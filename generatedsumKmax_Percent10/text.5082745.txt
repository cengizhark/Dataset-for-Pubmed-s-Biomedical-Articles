Unfortunately, no other resources were open on Westgrid that allowed us to compare them.In the next section, the main results are presented. The Breezy specifications are summarized in Table 2. The Breezy specifications are summarized in Table 2. EvaluationOn this configuration, the sequential and parallel implementations were executed, following the designed experiments.6.2.1. Data sizeRegarding the different sizes of the database, important improvement were obtained by the parallel implementation. Table 3 shows these values. Table 3 shows these values. speedup is increased when the number of threads is larger. Several experiments were designed to evaluate our implementation, using as a baseline Breezy cluster, in Westgrid grid. However, these values for parallel implementation were increased close to linear. Together, TORQUE and Moab provide a suite of commands for submitting jobs, altering some of the properties of waiting jobs (such as reordering or deleting them), monitoring their progress and killing ones that are having problems or are no longer needed. a cluster on Westgrid) there is available BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), which is a suite of tools for assessing the similarity of a given sequence of proteins or nucleotides with a database of sequences [21]. Many applications of Machine Learning methods have been developed for use in Bioinformatics. Taking these issues into consideration, a shared memory machine technique for parallel implementation was finally selected, using OpenMP (a C based parallel programming language) and C++ language. These parameters are: data size and precision. Indeed, we have considered one more parameter related to the grid, i.e.
