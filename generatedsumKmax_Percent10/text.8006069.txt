Thus, the effect of single cell stimulation on behavioral performance could be dependent not only on the training, but also on the task demand or even on the brain state [5]. Although the mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects of single neurons activation are still under investigation, these experiments altogether demonstrate that holographic optogenetics can be used to manipulate ensembles, proving a causal relation between ensemble activity, perception and learned behaviors. While these experiments have been performed in mouse primary visual cortex, the presence of coactive ensembles of neurons that are causally related to behavior has also been observed in cnidar-ians [37], given credence to the idea that, like the genetic code, some basic features of the neural code could be similar across phyla. Finally, the identification of neuron subtypes belonging to neuronal ensembles in conjunction with trascriptomics [45] will be necessary to target molecularly identified subtypes of neurons with holographic optoge-netics and to understand their role in functional microcircuits across brain areas.The neuronal ensemble hypothesis could have significant repercussions for translational neuroscience and medicine. Such single cell methods could be used to manipulate memories or circuit states in mental or neurological diseases. The characterization of the circuit mechanisms underlying changes in cortical neuronal ensembles related to memory and behavior could be extended to different brain regions to define biomarkers of population activity to diagnose and intervene during pathological states [5].
