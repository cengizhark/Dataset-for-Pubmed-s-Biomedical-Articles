This may be due to the relatively small study population and in particular to the small BRCA1/2 subpopulations. Lastly, the manual segmentation is a time consuming process hindering translation into clinical daily practice. Gerlinger et al  was able to reveal branched evolutionary tumor development in metastatic renal cell carcinoma manifesting inter-site tumor heterogeneity, with the clinical implication that single site biopsy underrepresents genetic alterations and is not able to display the complete mutational burden [11]. CT data acquisitionAbdomino-pelvic CT scans were performed on a CT scanner from General Electric (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with multiple detector rows (4 to 64). After that, segmentation and data extraction was performed using an open-source medical image processing software (ITK-SNAP) [17]. Each lesion was contoured individually on each single slice, and a region of interest (ROI) was generated and tagged with a color coded label according to its anatomical location (e.g., primary ovarian mass(es), omentum, peritoneal, left upper quadrant). To calculate the above mentioned features, at least two metastatic sites are needed in order to reach sufficient validity. PFS was defined as the time between the preoperative CT scan and progression (determined based on either follow-up CT examination and / or CA-125 level). Log-rank test was used to test for significant differences between the survival curves. Therefore, we hypothesized that an advanced computational analysis would be able to quantitatively analyze phenotypic traits of standard of care CT scans not apparent to the naked eye.
