As mentioned in the results section above, the lapsed time between PSGs was approximately 9 months. Despite these limitations, we feel that this study is important, as it demonstrates that obstructive sites can be consistently identified during DISE for children with REM-predominant OSA. DISE using DEX and ketamine as an anesthetic agent is a useful technique for the evaluation of upper airway obstruction in children with REM-predominant OSA without tonsillar hypertrophy. All variables were recorded with the TwinÂ® digital acquisition system (Grass Technologies, Pleasanton, CA). Drug-induced sleep endoscopyAll children underwent DISE as part of our standard evaluation to determine the site(s) of upper airway obstruction. The levels that were assessed included the internal nasal valve, nasal septum, inferior turbinates, nasopharynx (including adenoid tissue), palate orientation, velum, oropharynx, tongue base, lingual tonsils, epiglottis, supraglottis (including the false vocal cords, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds), and the true vocal folds. At our institution, DEX and ketamine are also the preferred anesthetics for both DISE and CINE MRI as part of the diagnostic airway workup for children with OSA without tonsillar hypertrophy. In a previous (2007) study of 26 children with persistent OSA after AT undergoing propofol-induced sleep endoscopy, families of 92% of the children reported symptomatic improvement after DISE-directed surgery [4]. In our 2017 study of 56 children without tonsillar hypertrophy (both those with persistent OSA and infants with OSA), we demonstrated significant improvements in both postoperative oAHI (P = 0.001) and oxygen saturation nadir (P < 0.001) after DISE-directed surgery [6]. Despite these findings, none of these studies assessed the impact of REM predominance on DISE-directed surgery outcomes.
