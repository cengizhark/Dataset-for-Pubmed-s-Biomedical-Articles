Mice were presented with a 12-second tone followed by pellet dispenser click and pellet drop (CS). The high level of AC5 expression in the striatum suggests that this isoform may be important for certain forms of striatum-dependent learning. It has been hypothesized that DA facilitates the learning of environmental contingencies by mediating plasticity mechanisms that strengthen or weaken corticostriatal inputs associated with reward delivery (Wickens et al , 1996; Schultz et al , 1997; Reynolds et al , 2001; Reynolds and Wickens, 2002; Wickens et al , 2003; Schultz, 2006). Recent studies indicate a potential role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in the NAcc in appetitive Pavlovian learning (Shiflett et al , 2008). No significant D1-mediated increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 positive neurons was seen in the dorsal striatum, consistent with published results (Gerfen et al , 2002). These data indicate that AC5 is specifically required for appetitive Pavlovian learning. The role of DA in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning has been studied extensively (Schultz, 1998; Dalley et al , 2002; Eyny and Horvitz, 2003; Day et al , 2007). Reports that either D1 or NMDA receptor antagonism can inhibit appetitive Pavlovian learning (Di Ciano et al , 2001; Eyny and Horvitz, 2003) are consistent with this view. The reward pathway is often implicated in impulsive choice behavior (Belin et al , 2008). One, DA signaling is critical to these behaviors but mediated through downstream effectors other than AC5. Recent studies have identified non-cAMP dependent DA receptor signaling pathways in MSNs mediating DA dependent behaviors (Beaulieu et al , 2005). The distinct neural substrates that underlie these specific forms of appetitive associative learning, however, have not been fully determined and characterized. Following two-lever training, testing for contingency was conducted for 5 days. Each trial consisted of presentation 12-s, 85-db, 2700-Hz tone (conditioned stimulus (CS)) followed by a click of the pellet dispenser and the drop of a single 20 mg sucrose pellet. Freezing behavior was monitored every 5 seconds, and a freezing score was calculated as total number of 5-s bins the subject was immobile divided by total 5-s bins in the session. Sections were first washed in 0.1M Tris buffered saline followed by blocking in 4% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton. Sections were first washed in 0.1M Tris buffered saline followed by blocking in 4% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton. Sections were first washed in 0.1M Tris buffered saline followed by blocking in 4% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton. For counting p-ERK1/2 positive neurons, six successive sections through the nucleus accumbens separated by 120 Î¼m, beginning at approximately 1.20 mm anterior to Bregma were used for counting. Fear conditioning was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures design, and baseline differences were analyzed using a Student's t-test. Cell counting data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures design. As the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), areas with high AC5 expression (see Supplemental Fig.
