Overall, we present a new type of metagenomic data analysis that provides an accurate quantitative estimate of the growth dynamics of the microbiota from a single snapshot sample. We grew in vitro cultures of Escherichia coli (K-12 strain) and sequenced them at multiple time points during late lag phase, exponential phase, and early stationary phase (23). During stationary phase, when most of the cells in the culture are not growing and thus have a single copy of their genome, we found uniform coverage across the genome (Fig. the virulent strain displayed significantly higher counts (Mann-Whitney p<0.05, Fig. the virulent strain displayed significantly higher counts (Mann-Whitney p<0.05, Fig. the virulent strain displayed significantly higher counts (Mann-Whitney p<0.05, Fig. S8), and for 55 strains whose replication origin location is unknown our method generated novel predictions (Fig. S10Bâ€“D), indicating that host genetics may affect the growth dynamics of this bacterium. Overall, these results provide examples of functional insights that are not achievable using traditional metagenomics analysis methods, and indicate that microbiome growth dynamics vary across diverse physiological conditions and locations.
