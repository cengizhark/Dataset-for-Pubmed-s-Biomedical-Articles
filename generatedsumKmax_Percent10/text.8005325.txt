PCLV primers were previously published: [PCLV-N-qRT-FW: ATAGTGTGGGACGAGGAGGG, PCLV-N-qRT-RV: AGGTGCCAACAGGAAACACT] (Schnettler et al , 2016). mosquitoes and there is a continuing effort to reduce infection through targeting the mosquito host. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 minutes, rinsed, and plaques were counted. Cells were infected with the African ZIKV MR766 and Puerto Rican ZIKV PRVABC59 strains at a low MOI (MOI 0.1) and incubated for six days. Supernatant was collected for six days and ZIKV RNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The presence of mosquito Rps6 transcripts confirmed successful RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Aag2 cells are more frequently utilized for DENV virus studies (Walker et al , 2014) and CFAV has previously been shown to promote DENV infection (Zhang et al , 2017) suggesting that PCLV may have a more mild effect on DENV growth in a coinfection setting. Cells were infected at a low MOI of 0.1 and a high MOI of 10 with LACV followed by a six or three day incubation, respectively, as depicted in Figure 4A. Nhumirim virus has been shown to limit WNV, St Louis encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Kenney et al , 2014). Because CFAV has previously been reported to be beneficial to DENV replication (Zhang et al , 2017), it is likely that PCLV or a synergistic interaction between PCLV and CFAV causes the observed block in flavivirus replication. Sindbis virus infection has been shown to prevent cell line infection with other alphaviruses (Karpf et al , 1997). Innate immune competent cells such as the A. aegypti cell lines (Aag2 and CCL-125s) represent additional cell lines but have shown variability in virus susceptibility (Singh, 1967; Singh and Paul, 1968; Wikan et al , 2009). Cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) was first identified in 1975 in A. aegypti cells, and was shown to cause a cell fusing phenotype in A. albopictus cells (Stollar and Thomas, 1975). A. albopictus derived C710 cells from Ann Fallon were cultured in E-5 media (Schultz et al , 2017) and subcultured 1:10 weekly. Cells were subcultured 1:10 weekly. Virus supernatant was spun at 4,000 RCF, filtered and aliquoted. Supernatant RNA was extracted by Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit per manufacturer recommendations. Cells were incubated at 28Â°C with 5% CO2 for 6 days. Media was replaced at 24 hours post infection. PCLV primers were previously published: PCLV-N-FW: CAGTTAAAGCATTTAATCGTATGATAA, PCLVN-RV: CACTAAGTGTTACAGCCCTTGGT (Schnettler et al , 2016). Rps6 primers used target a conserved region of A. aegypti and A. albopictus Rps6 gene: mRpS6_F AGTTGAACGTAT CGTTTCCCGCTAC and mRpS6_R GAAGTGACGCAGCT TGTGGTCGTCC (Lee et al , 2012). Supernatant RNA was extracted by Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit per manufacturer recommendations.
