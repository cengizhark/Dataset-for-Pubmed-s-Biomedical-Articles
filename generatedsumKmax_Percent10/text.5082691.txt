Information on ER, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and tumor characteristics were abstracted from pathology reports.A single control was matched to each case on factors at blood collection; age (within 1 year), month (+/− 1 month) and time of day (+/− 2 hours) of blood collection, fasting status (>=10 hours since last meal vs. <10 hours or unknown), and menopausal status and menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use (premenopausal, postmenopausal/no HT use, postmenopausal/HT use, unknown menopausal status). FlOP_360 characterizes the interaction between lipid oxidation productions and protein, DNA and carbohydrates [24]. Thus, we adjusted for this batch variation using methods described by Rosner et al [31] as we have used previously [32]. All statistical tests were two-sided and p values were considered statistically significant at <0.05; analyses were conducted in SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two-sided and p values were considered statistically significant at <0.05; analyses were conducted in SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For FIOP_360 and FIOP_400, results did appear to differ according to BMI at blood collection although the interactions were not statistically significant (pint=0.23 and pint=0.37 respectively). It is also possible that different time periods of exposure may have differing effects for carcinogenesis.
