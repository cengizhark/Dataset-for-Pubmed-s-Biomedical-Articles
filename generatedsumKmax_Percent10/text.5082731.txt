Patient clinical data for samples from Timika are shown in Table 2. Median parasitemia was 2,195 parasites/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 810.75–4640.25 parasites/µL), with 11 patients (92%) treated with artemisinin combination therapy and one patient (8%) treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. These include cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 10 (Couper et al , 2008; Plebanski et al , 1999) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (Omer and Riley, 1998; Walther et al , 2005), as well as immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 (Jacobs et al , 2002; Schlotmann et al , 2000), LAG-3 (Butler et al , 2011; Illingworth et al , 2013), PD-1 (Butler et al , 2011; Hafalla et al , 2012), and TIM-3 (Costa et al , 2015; Huang et al , 2013). As a positive control, 25 µL of a mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (PHA, final concentration 10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), was added into corresponding wells. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie near infrared (NIR) fixable viability kit (BioLegend) was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. Then, 1–5 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of surface antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min on ice, protected from light. Next, 100 µL of BD Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each well and incubated on ice for 20 min, protected from light. Then, 2 µg/mL (final volume of 50 µL) of intracellular antibody (IFNγ PeCy7 and IL-10 PE), diluted in BD Perm buffer was added per well and incubated on ice for 60 min, protected from light. Samples were generally acquired within 12–24 hr post-staining. Next, 1 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of Zombie NIR fixable viability kit was diluted in HBSS, added to each well, and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature, protected from light. Then, 1–5 µg/mL (in a final volume of 50 µL) of surface antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer and Brilliant stain buffer (Cat# 563794; BD Biosciences), added to each well, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, protected from light. Then, 5 µg/mL (final volume of 50 µL) of intracellular antibody (IFNα PE), diluted in BD Perm buffer, was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 45–60 min, protected from light. For the positive selection of CD4+ cells, after the first elution, the sample was loaded onto a fresh column and then underwent a second round of elution to increase the purity of selected population. RNA concentration and quality were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. Primers for the following genes were purchased from Quantitect (QIAGEN), ifnα1, ifnα2, ifnα4, ifnα5, ifnα6, and ifnβ. qPCRs were performed in duplicate, using the GoTaq qPCR kit for SYBR green (A6001; Promega) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad) per manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between groups were determined using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (day 0 versus day 7 or day 0 versus day 14), and the linear regression function was used to analyze associations between IL-10 or IFNγ levels and the AUC by GraphPad Prism v.6 for Windows; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Type I IFNs have been shown to inhibit the activity of various innate immune cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (Auerbuch et al , 2004; Berry et al , 2010; Carrero et al , 2004; Desvignes et al , 2012; Parker and Prince, 2012; Stanley et al , 2007; Xin et al , 2010).
