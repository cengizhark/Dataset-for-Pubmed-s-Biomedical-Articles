3B) (c.f., IC50 (MMDX) = 24 nM in A549 controls 27). 3B) (c.f., IC50 (MMDX) = 24 nM in A549 controls 27). In an effort to chemosensitize the cells to MMDX at lower Adeno-3A4 MOIs, cells were co-infected with Onyx-017, an E1B-55kd-deleted oncolytic adenovirus that selectively replicates in p53-deficient tumor cells and can be used as a helper virus to co-amplify and increase the expression and cellular transmission of replication-defective virus encoding CYPs 2B6 and 2B11 6, 34. This toxicity was also apparent from the body weight loss of 3–7 g seen for the 9L and 9L/3A4 tumor-bearing mice following i.v. Although a 2–4 g body weight loss was observed in the 9L/3A4 tumor-bearing mice on days 10 and 17 after the first i.t. A decrease in CYP3A4 protein content was also seen when P450 reductase was introduced into CHO/3A4 cells, although in that case a large increase in overall CYP3A metabolic activity was obtained (Fig. Supplementary Materials and MethodsMaterials, and methods used for Western blotting, P450 reductase assay, qPCR analysis, CYP3A4 adenovirus preparation and adenovirus-mediated RNA transcription, protein expression and enzyme activity are available on-line as Supplementary Materials. Gene therapy vectors that give high levels of P450 expression (e.g., adenoviral vectors) 34 may be particularly demanding in terms of the requirement for P450 reductase, particularly in the case of CYPs that have a low apparent affinity for P450 reductase 50. Nevertheless, despite the very low concentration of MMDX, there is sufficient formation of the active MMDX metabolite to effect tumor cell killing. Further work will be needed to develop strategies for increasing intratumoral CYP3A4 protein and activity in vivo, e.g., by taking advantage of the recently described stabilizing effect of NFκB on CYP3A4 protein 52, before this CYP3A4 gene therapy can be implemented in the clinic. P450-based GDEPT using cyclophosphamide-activating CYP2B enzymes improves intratumoral 4-OH-cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and enhances antitumor activity in vivo, with the greatest improvements obtained when cyclophosphamide is administered by directly intratumoral injection 53, 54. Quantitation of 4-OH-IFA production and active MMDX formation by tumor cells expressing CYP3A49L/3A4 cells were plated in 12-well culture plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 1.5ml culture medium. Cells cultured in DMEM medium to 75% confluence were trypsinized and washed in PBS and then adjusted to 2 × 107 cells/ml of FBS-free DMEM. Other P450 prodrugs investigated in preclinical gene therapy studies include ifosfamide (IFA) 16, 17, an isomer of cyclophosphamide, and the bioreductive drugs tirapazamine 18 and AQ4N 19. Drug-free controls were injected i.t. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: V = π/6 (L × W)3/2. Retroviral expression of human CYP3A4 chemosensitizes 9L gliosarcoma cells to MMDX and IFARetrovirus encoding CYP3A4 cDNA was used to infect 9L tumor cells, which were selected based on their acquired resistance to puromycin.
