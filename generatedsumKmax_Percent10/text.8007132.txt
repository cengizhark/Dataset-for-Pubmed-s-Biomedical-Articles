Dissemination of the synthetic route to the prepared antagonist analogues, definition of the pharmacophore, probing of structure–activity relationships via synthetic analogues, and the optimization of in vitro potency of prepared molecules are reported. 4.1.Minimum inhibitory concentration assays4.1.1.Cell culture and in vitro functional assaysHEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). To test the effects of the novel compounds on FGF-23-mediated activation of FGFR1/α-KL complex, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either empty expression vector or full-length human α-KL along with the ERK luciferase reporter system12 and Renilla luciferase-null as internal control plasmid. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the transfected cells were treated with each of the newly synthesized compound (10−5 M) or selected compound with a range of 10−9 ~ 10−4 M in the presence or absence of 1 nM FGF23 for IC50. To test cytotoxicity of the selected compounds, HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 104/well. The LDH released from the cells exposed to different concentrations (10−6 ~ 10−3 M) of the compound were normalized to the amount of LDH released from vehicle-treated cells receiving 10 μL of 10 × Lysis Solution (100%, maximum LDH release) and were corrected for baseline LDH released from vehicle-treated cells. Evaluation of ring size through the 5- and 6-membered common rings, in addition to heteroarene constructs was also performed (Scheme 2).arene and heteroarene constructs were evaluated. The original vHTS hit was divided into three zones for functional group manipulation towards understanding the impacts of various structural features of a given antagonist analogue on in vitro efficacy (Fig. A vinyl derivative lacking any aryl ring (8u), as well as direct connect aryl moieties (8l-8s) were prepared. The unoptimized current synthetic route is reproducibly robust and can support future assay studies without extensive reoptimization.22 With the realization of a viable synthetic strategy to produce relevant analogues of 1 for structure-activity studies, the focus of the research shifted to evaluating the in vitro efficacy of the prepared analogues. Compounds 8m and 8o, direct-connect, aromatic derivatives of 8a and 8b, which negated the vinyl group, demonstrated lower than half biological activity compared to 1 and further validated the relevance of extension of conjugation, or electron density, as potential influences on increased activity. Based on the initial in vitro results presented, eight analogues were selected from Groups I to IV for IC50 determinations (Table 2).The IC50 values of prepared FGF-23 antagonist analogues evaluated ranged from 0.14 μM (13a) to 31 μM (6a) with a ranked order of 13a (0.14 μM), 8a (0.20 μM), 8c (0.37 μM), 14b (0.39 μM), 9b (0.52 μM), 8n (2.79 μM), 8 l (10 μM), 8o (12.3 μM) and 6a (31 μM), respectively. On the aryl ring of 8a and 8c, a 4-position electron-donating substituent CH3 for 8a and the resonance-donating substituent OCH3 for 8c largely increases the efficacy, leading to 10 ~ 25-fold higher potency for inhibiting FGF-23 activity when compared to 1 (IC50 5.0 μM) in Group I. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data was obtained utilizing electron impact ionization (EI) with a magnetic sector (EBE trisector), double focusing-geometry mass analyzer.
