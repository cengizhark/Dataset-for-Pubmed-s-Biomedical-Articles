Our finding that Nono functions as a bivalent chromatin factor in mESCs is consistent with this prediction.Our study shows that Nono interacts and co-localizes with Erk2 and RNAPIIS5P at bivalent genes in mESCs, while a previous study also reported that Nono binds both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RNAPII CTD at Ser5 (Emili et al , 2002). Since Nono is reported to bind mRNAs and required for mRNA processing in differentiation cells (Clemson et al , 2009; Fox et al , 2002; Fox and Lamond, 2010; Hutchinson et al , 2007; Li et al , 2009; Sunwoo et al , 2009), it is conceivable that such a mechanism may be critical for Nono-bound bivalent genes to produce mature mRNAs once mESCs leave the primed state to differentiate. It will also be of importance to evaluate whether this mechanism is conserved in the regulation of ESCs of human and other species.In summary, our findings highlight a function for Nono in mESCs where it plays a critical role at the chromatin interface to regulate Erk signaling, impacting the integrity of bivalent chromatin at developmental genes and mESC pluripotency. Nono loss compromises mESC differentiationWe next investigated whether Nono null cells also exhibit compromised ability to undergo differentiation as a result of an impaired Erk activity and compromised activation of Nono/Erk co-bound bivalent genes. Additionally, although Nono KO teratomas were able to develop all three germ layers (Figure S4B), they by and large gave rise to much smaller ectoderm-derived, keratinized epithelium tissues (Figure S4B, left) and fewer mesoderm-derived muscle tissues (Figure S4B, middle), but no obvious alterations of endoderm-derived intestinal epithelium tissues (Figure S4B, right).It’s important to note that, consistent with our molecular findings that Nono and Erk reciprocally regulate each other, Nono KO mESCs behaved similarly as the PD03 treated (Figure S4C and S4D) and Erk2 KO mESCs (Kunath T et al , 2007), in our EB and monolayer NSC differentiation assays.Taken together, we find that Nono KO mESCs displayed many similarities to 2i “ground state” and PD03 treated mESC in terms of the robust self-renewal capability, resistance to differentiation as well as epigenomic and transcriptomic features.
