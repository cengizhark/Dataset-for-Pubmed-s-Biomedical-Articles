Next, we identified and included covariates that had significant relationships (p < .05) with both the outcome and predictor variables. All analyses were conducted using Stata 13.1. Many of the youth in our sample endorsed substance use; 63% ever used marijuana, 40% youth reported marijuana use in last 30 days, 24% reported ever using hard drugs, 51% reported daily tobacco use, and 25% reported heavy episodic alcohol use. Those with higher HS were less likely to endorse heavy episodic drinking, daily tobacco use, recent or lifetime marijuana use, and having sex after using substances (p = <.05). Youth who had high hope were also marginally less likely to have sex after substance use (AOR 0.481, p = .065). None of the other substance use behaviors remained associated with higher HS in these adjusted models (Table 3). It is possible that the sample size was too small to detect significant associations.
