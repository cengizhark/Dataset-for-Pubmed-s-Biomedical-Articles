The elevated STI risk for Blacks irrespective of individual risk behaviors26 is likely due to higher STI prevalence in this sub-population and assortative mixing by race. Finally, our study sample was primarily white and these findings should be tested for replication in other racial ethnic groups. The impact of these SRB on risk for STI was clear and consistent across gender, despite differential influence of several precursors to the risk behaviors. Detailed information on the measures is available in Supplementary Table 1.Sexually transmitted infection (STI)At each of 8 assessments starting at age 18, participants were asked if they had ever been told by a doctor or nurse that they had an STI (HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, genital warts, genital herpes, or other STI). and summed, then standardized.Environmental factorsAll environmental factors were measured at 4 timepoints (ages 11-14) using a four-point scale (1=NO! A school bonding 5-item scale reflected the degree to which participants liked their teachers and classes and wanted to do well in school.Demographic controlsChildhood socioeconomic status (SES) was measured as school report of eligibility for the National School Breakfast/Lunch program from ages 6-13 (qualifiction in any year was classified as lower SES). Statistical AnalysesIn bivariate analyses, we compared characteristics of participants with and without STI using Poisson regression with robust standard errors18,19 to generate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the combined model with SRB and individual and environmental factors, number of sex partners and inconsistent condom use remained strongly associated with STI; higher social skills remained significantly associated with reduced risk of STI. The most consistent predictor of SRB was having antisocial peers in early adolescence.
