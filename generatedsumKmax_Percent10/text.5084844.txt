Owing to lack of specificity with some ICD-9-CM procedure codes, we optimized case capture by using ICD-9-CM codes for tendon and muscle repairs, as well as reattachment of fingers and thumb. Our procedure and diagnosis code list was reviewed and verified for completeness by our University billing and coding specialists. the slope, to follow the change over time, and also calculated the absolute effect of the expansion at the end of the study period.21Lastly, based on NY demographic data 22 we also calculated population-adjusted numbers of patients treated in each quarter across the study period to evaluate the absolute number of Medicaid and uninsured patients who received the replantation surgeries.
