Interestingly, a corneal wound caused by chemical cauterization induces capillaries to sprout and grow directly towards the wound edge (Burger et al , 1983). In breast cancer, for example, potential differences between proliferating and non-proliferating regions can be measured at the surface of the skin and are being used diagnostically because they correlate well with malignancy of the neoplasm (Cuzick et al , 1998). Although electric stimulation seems to promise a new approach to promoting angiogenesis in vivo (Kanno et al , 1999; Patterson et al , 1999), the cellular and molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Apart from its involvement in Ca2+ regulation, p160ROCK or Rho kinase can enhance the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Kimura et al , 1996). In the heart, this leads to a flow of injury current, intracellularly through junctionally coupled cells, with an extracellular return loop, and is thought to be involved in arrhythmogenesis (Coronel et al , 1991). In 70% of those cells, Vargas et al  (Vargas et al , 1994) observed that a small outward current was activated with a threshold of 0 mV (depolarization of membrane potential), whereas inward rectifying currents were activated with a threshold of 100 mV (hyperpolarization). However, it is unlikely that electro-osmotic water movement mediates the effects of a DC EF. In diastole, damaged extracellular areas become negative relative to undamaged areas, and this is reversed in systole, although the currents become more diffuse and are around one-third of their diastolic magnitude (Kleber et al , 1978). 0.011 for culture medium at 37°C), h is the channel height (~200 μm) and b is the channel width (1 cm for our chamber) (Albuquerque et al , 2000; Levesque and Nerem, 1985). Extracellular injury currents, which create directly measured DC EFs of 58 mV cm−1, extend over about 8 mm at the boundary between ischemic and normal tissue (Coronel et al , 1991). The VEGFR inhibitor (catalog number 676475), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (catalog number 440202), the Akt inhibitor (catalog number 124005) and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (catalog number 688001) were all from Calbiochem. Frequently (perhaps always), it occurs in the presence of directly measured endogenous EFs, which are generated by active ion transport across polarized epithelia and endothelia (Barker et al , 1982; Jaffe and Stern, 1979; Jaffe and Vanable, 1984; Nuccitelli, 1992; Hotary and Robinson, 1992; McCaig and Zhao, 1997; Zhao et al , 1999a). When the extent of ion pumping or of tissue electrical resistance varies spatially, steady direct-current (DC) EFs arise extracellularly (McCaig et al , 2002). Marked elevation of VEGF in the culture medium was observed as early as 5 minutes after onset of the EF; this was reduced at 1 hour and 2 hours, rose again at 4 hours, and reached a high level by 24 hours (Fig. This drug is a potent VEGFR inhibitor that inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinase activity (50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.0 μM and 100 nM for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, respectively). It is very selective for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity compared with that associated with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (50-fold and 3800-fold, respectively) (Hennequin et al , 1999).
