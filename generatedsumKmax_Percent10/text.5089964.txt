In the management of IDH-mutant gliomas, aggressive surgery targeting all non-enhancing areas of disease remains the standard first-line treatment since, in low grade gliomas (which again are largely IDH mutant), a significant correlation has been demonstrated between maximal tumor resection and overall survival [11]. Accordingly, IDH status was prognostic but not predictive in the retrospective analysis of the German Glioma Network NOA-04 trial, in which patients with anaplastic gliomas were randomized to receive first either RT or CT (PCV or temozolomide) and upon disease progression to receive the other treatment modality [24]. Hence, no statements can be made about the predictive implication of molecular markers in this patient group.
