However, little data are available in fail older patients with multiple comorbid conditions who are at the highest risk of future fracture. Whether findings from previous studies conducted in younger, healthier cohorts translate to an older, sicker population remains to be seen. TBS was extracted from the PA spine DXA measurements at baseline, 12 and 24 months using TBS iNsight software (Medimaps Group, Geneva, Switzerland). Inter- and intra-assay variability was 3.66% and 8.15% for CTX and 4.79% and 4.14% for PINP, respectively.Functional assessments at baseline included the Katz Activities of Daily Living scale [20], Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale [21], gait speed [22,23], Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire [24], Comorbidity Index [25], modified Fried Frailty Index (categorized as frail, prefrail or robust) [26] and the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test [27]. We also used the said categorical operational definitions instead of the continuous ones in the mixed models, and obtained between-tertile differences. PatientsThe mean age ± standard deviation of the participants was 86.9 ± 5.1 years. PatientsThe mean age ± standard deviation of the participants was 86.9 ± 5.1 years. The average FRAX score for a hip fracture was 8.8 ± 9.2% and for a major osteoporotic fracture was 21.6 ± 9.9%.
