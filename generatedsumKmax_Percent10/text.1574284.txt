Values over unity imply a tendency to spread and calibrate the velocity of such spread (the larger the value, the greater the rate of spread). Differences between the two series plotted in (c) are illustrated in Fig. 3d and e. The mean values for the two series are used to define the swash and backwash stages of Wave III in Fig. 8 presents the cumulative curves for 14 separate measles epidemic waves in Iceland over the 60-year period for both newly-infected districts and newly-terminated districts. 9 which shows the superimposed cumulative curves from the previous figure to define susceptible, infective and recovered zones when plotted on a phase diagram. A fast epidemic wave will display a right-skewed distribution with the majority of cases occurring in the early phases of the epidemic and positive b1 values. Overall, the four standard measures of epidemic velocity suggest that the Icelandic waves we have studied show a distinct tendency to have relatively faster leading edges and relatively slower following edges. This spread process is set into reverse as populations recover and previously-infected areas are cleared. The duration of the stages averages around 8 months for swash and 11 months for backwash. A summary of the mechanisms involved and examples of such spread are given elsewhere (Haggett 2000; Cliff et al  2000). Is there any evidence from the analysis that the epidemic waves are changing systematically over time or may they be regarded as samples drawn from a relatively stable wave population? In the exemplar case, the threshold of the model was set to one (qij = 1). The swash–backwash model may be readily adjusted to include such non-discrete examples by resetting the threshold so that either (a) qij > 1 or (b) a particular threshold rate (cases/susceptible population) is exceeded. Making comparisons across different spatial scales and between countries (each of which has its own recording infrastructure) is a classic geographical problem which has long attracted statistical research (Duncan et al  1961). Here, we have concentrated on the changing spatial distribution of the wave, and we have presented a simple method for identifying the leading and trailing edges of the spatial advance and retreat of such waves. into a new area with a susceptible population which is open to infection. In this first section we modify standard statistical methods to provide some elementary measures of spatial form and then illustrate their application through a small hypothetical example. 3a, the 12×10 matrix is re-arranged so as to position the start cells in an ascending temporal order. 3b, so as to arrange the end cells in ascending temporal order. Bailey 1975) but with the essential difference that our population is made up of areas (SA, IA and RA) rather than individuals. The epidemiological significance of the integral values is discussed later in this paper. Higher moments about the mean can also be computed to yield valuable measures of epidemiological behaviour.
