Clinical data were obtained by direct examination of participants, review of medical records, and structured questionnaires.Variant identificationUW samples: Individuals affected by JBTS were previously screened using a molecular inversion probes (MIPs) targeted capture,4,9 covering AHI1 (MIM: 608894), ARL13B (MIM: 608922), ARMC9 (MIM:617612), B9D1 (MIM: 614144), B9D2 (MIM: 611951), C2CD3 (MIM: 615944), CPLANE1 (MIM: 614571), CC2D2A (MIM: 612013), CEP290 (MIM: 61042), CEP41 (MIM: 610523), CSPP1 (MIM: 611654), IFT172 (MIM: 607386), INPP5E (MIM: 613037), KIF7 (MIM: 611254), MKS1 (MIM: 609883), NPHP1 (MIM: 607100), OFD1 (MIM: 300170), RPGRIP1L (MIM: 610937), TCTN1 (MIM: 609863), TCTN2 (MIM: 613846), TCTN3 (MIM: 613847), TMEM138 (MIM: 614459), TMEM216 (MIM: 613277), TMEM231 (MIM: 614949), TMEM237 (MIM: 614423), TMEM67 (MIM: 609884), TOGARAM1 (MIM: 617618), TTC21B (MIM: 612014), and ZNF423 (MIM: 604557).In samples without biallelic rare, predicted-deleterious variants (RDVs), exome sequencing was performed as previously described10 using Roche Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 capture probes (36.5 Mb of coding exons) and paired-end 50 bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. Two fetuses (UW363â€“3 and AUMC-1) had polydactyly and polycystic kidneys in addition to occipital encephalocele, warranting a Meckel syndrome diagnosis (Table 1). The presence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in one fetus may indicate an increased risk for congenital heart defects, which should prompt a low threshold for echocardiogram, particularly if adequate cardiac views were not obtained by prenatal ultrasound. Based on the genetic and phenotypic overlap, Joubert and Meckel syndromes likely represent the milder and more severe ends, respectively, of a ciliopathy spectrum. Here the TZ partitions the cilium from the cytoplasm by regulating ciliary protein content and serving as a bi-directional diffusion barrier. The JBTS-associated proteins localize to multiple subregions of the cilium, but the TZ is a hotspot for ciliopathy-related proteins, and indeed, half of the JS-associated proteins localize to the region. This finding is supported by functional work localizing TMEM218 to the ciliary TZ and a mouse model recapitulating the retinal and kidney phenotypes.
