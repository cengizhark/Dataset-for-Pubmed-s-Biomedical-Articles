Key exclusion criteria were: cardiac index (CI) ≤2.0 L/min/m2 requiring inotropic agents within the last 6 months prior to screening, obstructive or restrictive cardiomyopathy, moderate to severe heart valve disease, or atrial fibrillation with resting heart rate > 100 b.p.m. Haemodynamic parametersHaemodynamic variables were measured at rest and during supine ergometer exercise. Ergometer resistance (Lode ergometer, Groningen, The Netherlands) was increased every 3 min with 20 W increments until maximal effort was achieved. A Swan – Ganz catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery via the internal jugular or brachial vein using fluoroscopy. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was calculated as 80 x (mean arterial pressure – mean CVP)/CO. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in Wood units was calculated as (mPAP – mean PCWP)/CO. Statistical analysesBaseline characteristics were compared using t-tests or rank-sum tests for continuous variables, as appropriate. Numerical values are reported as mean ± standard deviation, median [interquartile range (IQR)], or counts (%). To identify haemodynamic measures that were associated with 6MWT performance below or above the median, logistic regression was used with haemodynamic variables at rest, peak exercise, and absolute changes from rest to peak exercise.The assumptions of linear regression were formally tested and found to be true, except for co-linearity which was present between CVP and mPAP (rest), and mPAP and PCWP (rest/exercise), as expected. Regression coefficients are summarized in Table 3.At peak exerciseAt peak exercise, univariate associations were significant between 6MWT and CVP (P = 0.020), CI (P = 0.044), PCWP/CI (P = 0.037), and PCWL (P < 0.001).
