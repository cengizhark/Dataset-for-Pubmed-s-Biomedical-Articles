However, upon addition of 70 mM glucose at pH 7.8, the cell-repulsive state was turned on due to the competitive glucose binding on the surface. Moreover, D-glucose could be used as a competitor and block the binding sites of PFP-PBA, thereby turning off the cell membrane imaging.Concerning the multiple diols in the complex structures of carbohydrates, in some cases, the specific binding mode is important for further applications. 4.4Cell culture and deliveryDuring the last decade, hydrogels with high water content and optimal 3D structures have been playing important roles in mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to improved performances in cell delivery and cell culture compared to the corresponding 2D environments. In analogy to traditional polymers, the dynamic covalent counterparts can thus be built up through different arrangements of the connections, leading to various types of polymer architectures.Typically, there are two approaches for reversible bonds to be inserted into polymeric structures: main-chain and side-chain incorporation (Figure 1).19 The former strategy can lead to formation and collapse of polymer structures under specific conditions, resulting in degradable or self-healing biomaterials, whereas the latter approach can modulate the binding effects during the biorecognition process. In the linear case, homo- or hetero-ditopic complementary building blocks are adopted, whereas tritopic or even tetratopic components are required for construction of cross-linked polymers. Materials used for biological applications, such as cell culture and wound-dressing,73, 74 have taken advantage of the self-healing property of dynamic covalent polymers to achieve their specific functionalities.Recyclability is another important characteristic of dynamic covalent polymers, again enabled by the properties of the incorporated reversible bonds.57 Common covalent polymers cannot be fully restored to their original physical structures or mechanical performances after recycling. 3.3Mechanical propertiesDynamic covalent polymers combine the advanced mechanical properties of traditional polymers with the unique features of dynamic covalent bonds, and this can lead to intriguing new effects and altered mechanical performances of the polymers.22 Such mechanical features of dynamic covalent polymers can also be applied in biological systems, for example, by maintaining robust structures in different environments.82Conventional shape-memory polymers are able to recover the original (permanent) geometry after having been persuaded (programmed) into a temporary shape. 4.1Gene deliveryThe non-covalent recognition of nucleic acids by synthetic vectors requires combining multiple weak electrostatic interactions in order to achieve a stable interaction in biological media. This multivalent binding is best achieved using macromolecules such as polymers87–90 and dendrimers.91 Nucleic acids condensation92 is a complex multi-step process (interaction, complexation, folding) that results in the formation of “polyplexes” nanoparticles that can penetrate cells and deliver functional nucleic acids like pDNA, siRNA or mRNA, provided they have appropriate sizes and surface charges. Using siRNA as templates, they demonstrated the formation of polydisulfide nanocaplets of small and uniform size which depolymerize in the reductive cytosolic environment and liberate the packaged siRNA.112While dynamic covalent chemistry can happen between building blocks associated onto nucleic acids templates, Matile and coworkers have also found that dynamic covalent exchange can take place during the delivery process, evidencing a covalent and transient binding, through disulfide exchange, with the transferrin receptor which in turns promotes further cell penetration.102, 113, 114Barboiu and coworkers used imines as reversible covalent linkage for generating cross-linked dynamic covalent polymers, coined Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks (DCFs).117–120 The design uses commercially-available 1,3,5-benzenetrialdehyde, a building block which can be connected to mono-, di- and poly-amines through imine-bond formations (Figure 8). Normally, strategies such as protein engineering and chemical modification are required to improve enzyme performances, but long-term screening processes are usually required.
