Conformational rearrangements occurring in aptamer structures as a result of analyte binding7, 65 create the signals produced in homogeneous assays and are transduced by most sensory platforms (Fig. These dye-displacement methods require little structural characterization of the aptamer.For example, [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]+2 has no luminescence without oligo but luminesces upon intercalation. The resulting dsDNA provided intercalation sites for picagreen which then fluorescenced (λex = 490 nm, λem = 525nm). The resulting dsDNA provided intercalation sites for picagreen which then fluorescenced (λex = 490 nm, λem = 525nm). The malachite green aptamer (MGA) and spinach aptamers (SPNA) are examples for which the analyte fluorescence increases 2400-fold and 2000-fold, respectively, upon binding the aptamer.75, 76 Although there is little practical need to measure these analytes, the “switch-on” characteristic of these interactions can be used in chimeric formats for signal production. and dissociation constants of two aptamers are compatible, chimeric aptamers are an excellent means of creating a homogeneous assay in which an increase in signal results from analyte binding.An interesting approach that detects large aptamer structural changes is to use a water-soluble cationic poly-3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene derivative, a cationic polymer, which interacts with the negative backbone of DNA. Interaction of this polymer with the DNA in these two configurations differently orients the conjugated bonds and to create different colors. Aptamers are usually structurally more stable when in complex with analyte. In one case, an identified conformational change induced by analyte binding informed the design of two alternative anti-adenosine aptamers with either a fluorophore insertion or a modified uridyl base63; one with acridine in position 13 and the other with a fluorescein inserted between residues 7 and 8. For PDGF-BB, the LOD was in the nM range with a linear response up to 40 nM and for the thrombin aptamer, the dynamic range of response to K+ ions was 600 μM to 20 mM. By contrast, new sensors that involve antibodies appear to have reached a steady state. Structural changes in the aptamer due to analyte binding increase the probability for the aptamer-linked redox tag to strike the electrode, thereby increasing conductivity. A rapidly developing area of medical analysis, to detect circulating cancer cells, has been addressed by many groups with E-AB aptasensors.145-152 For example, lung cancer cells were detected by voltammetry with the bioelectrodes functionalized with lung cell-specific aptamers attached to indium-tin-oxide coated glass.153 The sensor displayed a linear concentration range of 103 to 107 cells/ml with a detection limit of 103 cells/ml and a response time of 60 sec.In the absence of extensive structural knowledge, buffer conditions can often be found in which the apo-aptamer is less stable than the aptamer-analyte complex, such as for the thrombin aptamer for which structural stability of the apo-aptamer decreases with ionic strength. However, the integration of ribozyme with aptamer can be achieved such that binding analyte results in either aptamer release or attachment to a sensor, depending on the ribozyme.176Important current developments for aptasensors include miniaturization and the ability to simultaneously measure multiple aptamer signals. Optical aptasensorsMost aptasensors developed for homogenous detection have been based on optical sensing with fluorescence changes being the most common signal measured upon ligand binding.In the first example of an optical aptasensor, thrombin binding by a fluorophore-labeled thrombin aptamer immobilized on a glass surface, was detected by evanescent wave-induced fluorescence anisotropy.180 Because evanescent waves decay exponentially with distance from the interface of refractive index, the induced fluorescence is sensitive to macromolecular conformational changes with the appropriate placement of fluorophore.181 The LOD was 5nM thrombin with a dynamic range up to 200 nm and less than 4% error. By contrast, dsDNA and/or aptamer-target complexes interact poorly with GO. By contrast, dsDNA and/or aptamer-target complexes interact poorly with GO. To date, externally applied aptamers have been used to monitor ATP with a molecular beacon type sensor in which fluorescence quenching is relieved by analyte binding198 or by using gold nanoparticles decorated with aptamer sequences hybridized to a short complementary Cy5-labeled reporter strand that is released on analyte binding with an accompanying increase in fluorescence.139 In the same vein, G– quadruplex structures, known to shift structure with K+-binding, were labeled at both ends with pyrene to produce molecular beacon type probes specific for K+ over Na+ and with a fluorescent output that reports on subcellular locations of K+.199 These NA probes must be placed in cells by way of forced endocytosis or other means that temporarily damages the cell membrane and generally involves delivery of some or all of the probe to the lysosomes where they are subject to degradation. However, the cellular damage and resulting cellular stress associated with healing membranes and regenerating lost cellular contents that occurs due to probe entry cannot be readily addressed when NA probes are applied extracellularly. Each experiment starts with a pool of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos, each with an internal randomized sequence, usually 30-80 nt, and terminal sequences complementary to predefined primers for PCR and/or RT-PCR. However, the recent application of next-generation sequencing combined with informatics analysis of the growing aptamer populations is a powerful improvement in the SELEX procedure.25 In addition to having large databases by which the growth (or disappearance) of sequence families can be followed, informatics can be applied to evaluate potential oligo structures, thereby allowing the incorporation of structure into the analysis to identify putative aptamers.26 Once identified, the putative aptamers can be synthesized to determine target affinity and specificity of binding over other possible targets. One of the most important considerations for designing SELEX experiments relate to the conditions of selection pressure, such as buffer and other environmental components, and the conditions of negative selection, including the presence of non-target molecules. The next steps are structure and sequence-guided molecular engineering that include truncation and/or mutation of the sequence(s) to develop the shortest aptamer(s) with highest affinity and specificity.
