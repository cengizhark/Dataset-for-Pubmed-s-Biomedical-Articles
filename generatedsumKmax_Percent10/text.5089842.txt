In a regression analysis, both the percent change in serosal EGG frequency (Fig. A number of possible mechanisms of how this neuromodulation is occurring have been discussed. It has been shown that GES therapy is not effective in improvement of gastric dysrhythmia.30,31 What chronic GES therapy is effective at improving or changing in terms of baseline neurophysiology, in particular baseline frequency and amplitude of gastric slow waves, has not been documented. In one study, with a cohort of 41 gastroparesis patients, 36 % had nearly no ICC, while the remainder had adequate amount of ICC. Data were retrospectively collected on all patients who had a permanent gastric pacemaker in which serosal EGG data of the initial GES device implantation could be found.
