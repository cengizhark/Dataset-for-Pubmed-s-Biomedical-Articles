It has been shown in several states that relative to rural areas, urban areas contain a disproportionately larger number of practicing dentists. (20) Our findings provide further evidence of the need for care coordination that links high-risk children to available dental providers, since many options for care are bypassed in favor of clinics that are further away and have longer wait times. Lastly, we did not map addresses for children who received dental care at a clinic noted as “other” on the survey, as we could not determine distances from their home addresses to unknown dental clinic locations. Although these decisions were made to produce the most favorable travel conditions for both driving and bus travel, this may have created bias for shorter travel times for driving since busses are also subject to traffic.PCC survey data was used to determine distances traveled by a sample of children from their home addresses to the PCC, and this was compared to distances traveled to their reported dental clinic, if known. Allegheny County contains 12% of all general dentists in Pennsylvania, which is the highest proportion in the state. Medicaid-insured Children using the PCC Live Proximal to Dental Clinics Accepting MedicaidWe found that many children travel to the PCC for medical care from locations that are further away than their nearest dental clinic. This study is the first to our knowledge to examine dental use by children living in a high resource area and characterize specific distance and travel-related variables to receiving dental care for young Medicaid-insured children.
