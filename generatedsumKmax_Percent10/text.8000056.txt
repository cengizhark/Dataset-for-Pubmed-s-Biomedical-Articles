This phenotype of ArpC3 mutant mice arises from a subpopulation of PFC neurons that project to the subcortical regions of the BLA and whose activity is bidirectionally tuned to social interaction and non-social bouts. Optogenetic activation of these neurons in WT mice during the initiation of social contact reproduces the reduced sociability of ArpC3 mutant and ctKO mice. Interestingly, social defeat in mice disrupts synchrony among the PFC and amygdala, which leads to stress-induced social dysfunction (Hultman et al , 2016). Elevation in the E/I balance is known to produce significant impairments in cortical processing and behavioral impairments associated with increased gamma band oscillations. By monitoring neural activity within the PL-BLA projection during social behaviors, we found two populations of neurons, social (+) and social (−), that bidirectionally represent social behavior, the tuning of which is altered in mice with reduced sociability. Conditional ArpC3 knockout (Arpc3f/f) and Ai-14 (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J; stock no. Ai-32 line (B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze/J; stock no. We show that loss of ArpC3 within this circuit is sufficient to recapitulate the reduced sociability of ArpC3 mutant mice. All procedures were conducted with a protocol approved by the Duke University and the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with US National Institutes of Health guidelines.We used HEK293T cells (ATCC; CRL-11268) to produce and purify adeno-associated viruses as well as to test the selective expression of Cre recombinase by co-expression of AAV-CreN-Rox-stop-Rox-CreC and AAV-WGA-Dre. The viral particles were then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (67,000 × g, 1 hr) using an iodixanol gradient solution (15%, 25%, 40% and 60%), and purified 3 times using an Amicon filter unit (100K MWCO; Millipore) by exchanging into PBS. For testing the circuit selective expression of Cre in the DG, AAV-CreN-Rox-stop-Rox-CreC (100nl; 1×1013 GC/ml) and AAV-WGA-Dre (100nl; 1×1013 GC/ml) were injected into each side of the DG (AP: −2.0, ML ± 1.5, DV: −2.0 from brain surface). Four weeks after surgery, brains were gently removed into ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution bubbled with 95% O2%–5% CO2 containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 10 D-glucose. During the recovery period (30 min), the slices were left in 35.5°C oxygenated aCSF containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 10 D-glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl and osmolarity set to 315 mosM. Recording pipettes (3.5–5.5 MΩ) contained the following (in mM): 150 K-Gluconate, 2 MgCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Na-ATP, and 0.2 Na-GTP, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH and osmolarity set to ~300 mosM.mEPSCs (miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents) were recorded with 1 μM tetrodotoxin and 50 μM picrotoxin in the bath solution in voltage-clamp mode (cells held at −70 mV). During the recordings, the slice was maintained under continuous perfusion of oxygenated aCSF with a temperature of 28 – 30°C and a flow rate of 2–3 mL/min. The mEPSC or mIPSC was detected using software in pCLAMP10.Cell biologyHEK293T cells were co-transfected with combinations of each viral construct (Ef1α-CreN-Rox-stop-Rox-CreC and Ef1α-WGA-Dre) and Cre-reporter Ef1α-Flex-GFP using FuGENE HD (Promega). The total distance traveled in each chamber, time spent on each chamber, number of transitions between chambers, and total distance moved were detected by photo beam breaks, and analyzed by Med Associates software.Elevated plus mazeThe elevated plus maze apparatus consisted of two open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two closed arms (30 × 5 cm) intersecting at a central platform (5 × 5 cm). Mice were connected to bilateral optic patch cables, placed in the center platform, and were allowed to explore for 15 min. Mice were connected to bilateral optic patch cables, placed in the center platform, and were allowed to explore for 15 min. During the elevated plus maze test, 5 min epochs with alternating laser stimulation was given (OFF-ON-OFF; 5 min per an epoch). This method allows accurate source extraction of cellular signals and addresses spatial overlaps between neurons. However, manipulating genes within isolated neural circuits is difficult to achieve with high specificity due to technical limitations. Thus, this circuit-selective Dre and Cre approach confers an innovative method to express Cre recombinase within select unidirectional neural circuits of the brain. Additional analysis of open field testing (OFT) also revealed no significant changes in locomotor, stereotypical, or rearing behaviors from controls (Figures S3A–S3E), demonstrating the specificity of the ctKO effectively segregated the altered social behavior from the locomotor disturbances seen in ArpC3f/f:CaMKllCre mice.Because the BLA is also known to regulate anxiety (Roozendaal et al , 2009), we conducted a light-dark emergence test to determine whether the ctKO mice displayed anxiety-like behavior (Figures S3F–S3L). The amplitude of ctKO IPSC was significantly decreased in the PL compared with control (Figures 4N and 4O; p < 0.05 with t test, p < 0.001 with KS test). To determine whether the PFC-BLA projection neurons of WT mice modulate their activity in response to social interactions and whether this is altered in the ctKO mice in real time, we unilaterally labeled the circuit with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (ctKI-GCaMP6s) using co-infection of AAV-Flex-GCaMP6s in PFC (Figure 5A).
