3-5, which compare the phylogenies of the three genes. In total there were 2199 significant χ2 peaks (P < 0.01, Bonferroni corrected) in PS120, 1030 in ompB, and 187 in ompA. In total there were 2199 significant χ2 peaks (P < 0.01, Bonferroni corrected) in PS120, 1030 in ompB, and 187 in ompA. It is noteworthy that this R. felis sequence is also partly responsible for the conflict between gene trees described above.Further support for recombination within the alignments comes from the Reticulate test. In all three cases, the NSS was higher than expected (ompB, NSS = 0.83, P = 0.001; PS120, NSS = 0.78, P < 0.0001; ompA, NSS = 0.92, P = 0.01). Although linkage disequilibrium declines with distance in all three genes, there is only consistent statistical support for this relationship in the case of PS120 (Table 7). It is unlikely that functional constraints on PS120 are preventing evolutionary change, because many amino acids evolve nearly neutrally in this protein. There were, however, significant differences in the phylogenetic trees inferred from two of the genes. 6) Such recombinant sequences can result in the recovery of trees that do not reflect the true phylogeny of either parental sequence (David and Keith 2002). I also found that the rate of recombination between different species of Rickettsia is low. The PS120 alignment includes amino acids 12–1020 of a total of 1026. Tree ReconstructionThe phylogenetic trees of these genes were reconstructed by maximum likelihood with the program PAUP* v.4.0b8 (Swofford 1998). The louse-vectored bacterium Rickettsia prowazekii causes one of the most severe diseases, epidemic typhus, which kills 10–30% of infected patients (Raoult and Roux 1997). The phylogeny of PS120 was reconstructed using the TVM + G model, which is identical to GTR + G except that the two types of transitions (A-G and C-T) occur at the same rate. The null distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic (2Δl, where Δl is the difference between the log-likelihood scores of the two models) can be approximated using the χ2 distribution with the degrees of freedom being the difference in the number of free parameters between the two models (two when comparing M7 and M8 and four when comparing M0 and M3). 1 and 2) was calculated as the average of the ω ratios across the all the ω classes from model 8, with the posterior probabilities used as weights. Potential breakpoints correspond to peaks in the values of χ2. Potential breakpoints correspond to peaks in the values of χ2. All P values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests performed on each alignment. The ω ratio of the PS120 encoding gene is highly heterogeneous across codons (M1 vs M3; Tables 4 and 5).
