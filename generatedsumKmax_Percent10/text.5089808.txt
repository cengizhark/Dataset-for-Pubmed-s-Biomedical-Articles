An ion-exchange chromatographic method has been developed for C-peptide isolation and further analysis by LC-MS. It is generally assumed that a charged protein is effectively retained by the ion exchanger of the opposite sign charge, however there is some experimental evidence of deviation from this simple rule (see [20], for example); this could be explained by electrostatic interactions of higher orders as well as possible hydrophobic interactions.The charge versus pH curve, or so-called “titration curve” for the C-peptide is shown in Fig.1. Thus, there exists only one basic group in the peptide. Applying a starting solution with a pH slightly above the C-peptide isoelectric point to a cation exchanger will allow C-peptide to pass through the column while trapping most of impurities. For the ion exchange purification stage, the pH range 3.5-4 was initially selected based on the theoretical predictions. The first series of experiments were quite successful, despite the fact that the method of theoretical modeling in general can be considered only approximation [16].The general scheme of C-peptide analysis included methanol precipitation as an initial stage to reduce the amount of ballast proteins. Here the total ion count is shown in selected ion monitoring mode for a sample treated with a cation exchanger and untreated (Figure 2A and Figure 2B, respectively). This phenomenon can potentially prevent accurate quantitation and should be addressed in the future research.In Figure 4, the mass spectra are shown for purified and concentrated C-peptide from a human serum sample.
