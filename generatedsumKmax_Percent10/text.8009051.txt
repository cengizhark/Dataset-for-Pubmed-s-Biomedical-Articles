Furthermore, competition for available resources also occurs between sibling colonies of the same strain of bacteria, indicating that under conditions of limited nutrients, bacteria can resort to cannibalism to survive.18 Considering the role of multi-species biofilms in disease and the inherent differences in virulence among strains of the same bacteria, it is pivotal to understand the complex inter-species and inter-strain interactions between microbial biofilm community members to elucidate the underlying mechanisms implicated in virulence, pathogenesis, and disease progression.In an early demonstration of the potential utility of chemical imaging to understand inter-species interaction (vide infra), Moree et al  analyzed colonies of P. aeruginosa and the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus cultured side-by-side on the same agar plate using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-FTICR MSI).13 The resultant maps of the secretome showed that phenazine metabolites produced by P. aeruginosa are transformed by A. fumigatus into other compounds possessing different chemical properties. At present, this result remains unexplained, however PAK remains motile even when co-cultured in the presence of an S. aureus agr-QS mutant, which lacks the gene to produce the only known S. aureus surfactant. The CRM microspectra are sufficiently strong to render strong, assignable features in the loading plot, Figure 5(b). The inter-cellular signaling process known as quorum sensing (QS) plays an important role in biofilm formation and development, both critical to the establishment of an infection.
