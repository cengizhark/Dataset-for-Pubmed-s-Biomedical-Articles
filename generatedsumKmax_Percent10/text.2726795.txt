Numb-1 peptide-activated PBMC produced IFN-γ when incubated with SK-OV-3.A2 cellsNumb-1 and NICD-1 peptide-activated PBMC produced similar amounts of IFN-γ, in the first 24 h of co-culture with SK-OV-3.A2 cells. The strongest inhibition of Numb-1 peptide presentation was mediated by staurosporine, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of protein–serine–threonine kinase family, indicating that an identified kinase is involved in Numb [P]-lation and degradation. A novel approach to cancer therapy is to eliminate CSC with immune effectors. The amount of Numb did not change. Numb interacts with the aPKC binding partner, PAR-3. Asymmetric division of cells which contain both Notch and Numb results in one “mother” stem cell and one different cell [daughter/IP-stem cell [4, 32]]. We used gemcitabine (Eli-Lilly Indianapolis, IN), paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), 5-Xuorourcil (Sigma Chemical Co. St Louis, MO) and human recombinant DLL4 (rhDLL4, R&D Systems, Inc. Minneapolis, MN). mAb against rat Numb [P]-Ser264 and Numb [P]-Ser283 = Human Numb-L-P-Ser265 and 295 were prepared by Dr. Hiroshi Tokumitsu [34, 35]. The position of the corresponding residues to [P]-Ser264 and [P]-Ser283 of rat Numb differs among iso-forms. Rat [P]-Ser283 corresponds to Ser295 in human Numb-L. We used the designations [P]-Ser265 and [P]-Ser295 since they are close to the [P]-Ser positions reported in the recent literature. IC50 of anticancer drugsThe 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GEM, PTX and 5-FU was determined after a 72-h incubation with drugs as described [13]. In all activation procedures, we used IL-12 as co-factor followed by IL-2 48 h later. Immunoblotting and quantification of NECD, NICD, Numb, and Bcl-2 utilizing β-actin as a reference was performed in relation to actin in the same sample, as we described [8, 37]. Immunoblotting and quantification of NECD, NICD, Numb, and Bcl-2 utilizing β-actin as a reference was performed in relation to actin in the same sample, as we described [8, 37]. NEXT is further cleaved at Val1744 to generate free NICD [5, 21, 30].NECD levels decreased in GEMRes MCF7 cells compared with GEMSens MCF7 cells.
