Malvina Eydelman, MD, director of the Office of Ophthalmic, Anesthesia, Respiratory, ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat), and Dental Devices in the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality at the FDA remarked that “proactively working with stakeholders in the medical device ecosystem to solve both shared problems and problems unique to others allows [the FDA] to serve the American public better and to achieve our vision [to] collaborate to address critical public health needs and bridge scientific gaps, thereby stimulating innovation in the products we regulate.” The goal of the workshop was to bring together stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers, industry members, and the FDA, to discuss approaches to shorten the time from medical device conception to market release, stimulate innovation, and ensure that patients in the US are the first in the world to have access to high-quality, safe, and effective medical devices. Alfredo Dubra, PhD, highlighted that AO is essentially an agnostic technology, because it can be applied to a variety of imaging modalities to improve transverse resolution, yielding vast improvements in the resolution of microscopic structures, such as parafoveal cones, and possibly providing more insight into subtle clinical findings associated with disease diagnosis and progression. For example, the ANSI standard assumes aberrations will limit the retinal spot size to 30 μm, while AO systems regularly achieve spots sizes less than 5 μm. The AO session panel agreed that further work is needed to develop clear safety standards for AO technology.
