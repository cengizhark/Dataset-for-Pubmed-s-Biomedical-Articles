We observed a 2-fold increase in Atf3 mRNA in edited retina compared with unedited retina, in addition to marked 4-fold and 3-fold increases in Sprr1a and Galanin transcripts, respectively (Figure 5A). Therefore, we evaluated markers of immune and glial cell activation after IL-22 editing in the injured retina. Greater immune cell activity after IL-22 inhibitionTo characterize the immune cell response to IL-22 suppression, we analyzed the localization of microglia/macrophages among retinal layers after injury. We applied genome-wide in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function screening methods to define mechanisms of adult mammalian CNS axonal regeneration. Here, we leverage those in vitro results to characterize pathways that can be targeted to improve CNS neural repair in vivo. Here, we leverage those in vitro results to characterize pathways that can be targeted to improve CNS neural repair in vivo. Analysis of IL-22 inhibition revealed that endogenous IL-22 suppresses the inflammation after ONC and prevents upregulation of Stat3 activators DLK and RAGs. After suppression of IL-22, the axotomy signal mediated by DLK and p-STAT3 initiates greater and more-rapid cytokine and growth factor induction as well as glial migration and activation. Future studies of the multiple pathways demonstrated here are expected to provide new molecular avenues to promote neural repair.

Fourteen days following AAV injection, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Fourteen days following AAV injection, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Alexa 555-CTB (cholera toxin subunit B, Thermo Fisher) was injected intravitreally 14 d post-ONC injury to anterogradely label axons. Non-targeting shRNA was generated as a control (target sequence: CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA). Following maxi prep (QIAGEN), Sanger sequencing confirmed correct shRNA and sgRNA insertion using the U6 promoter sequencing primers (5′ to 3′) TGGACCATCCTCTAGACT and (5′ to 3′) GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATTC, respectively.Transfection of HEK293T cells and AAV vector productionCells were passaged the day before transfection at a density of 107 cells per 15-cm plate and were transfected at approximately 80% confluency. Briefly, 72 h following transfection, the supernatant was collected, filtered using a 0.22 μm cellulose acetate filter (Corning), and stored at −80°C. Seventy-two hours after HEK293T cell transfection, cells were collected, subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles to release viral particles into the supernatant, treated with DNaseI (10 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and benzonase (50 U/ml, Millipore) for 30 min at 37°C, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. Samples were compared against a standard curve derived from a virus of known titer diluted from 1013 to 108 copies per ml. Representative z stack images were taken at 20x using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).RGC survivalEyes were removed and fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature. Following a 1 h incubation in PBS containing 5% NDS, retinas were incubated with a Rbpms primary antibody (1:1000; PhosphoSolutions, #1830-Rbpms) for 3 d at 4°C. Cell counts were performed on an Axio Imager M2 (Zeiss) with a 10x objective, and representative images were taken at 40x on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). Secondary antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature using AF488 or AF555 IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen), or AF488 IgM (1:1000, Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: anti-Pten (1:1000, CST), anti-Il22 (1:1000, Millipore), anti-p-STAT3 (1:2000, CST), anti-DLK (1:1000, Genetex), anti-β-actin (1:2000, CST). Following cryopreservation in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose at 4°C for 30 min, 2 h and overnight, respectively, eyes were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and sectioned at 10 μm using a cryostat. Following primary antibody application and washing, tissue was subsequently incubated in AF594, AF546, AF647, or AF488 secondary antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Retinas were subsequently washed in PBS, incubated with an AF488 secondary antibody (1:400; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, and washed in PBS.FACS sorting, next-generation sequencing and indel detectionFourteen days after AAV injection with either LacZ or Il22 sgRNA-AAV, single retinas were enzymatically digested in 0.125% collagenase for 1 h at 37°C. Following mechanical digestion and single-cell suspension, cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% BSA) and blocked with a monoclonal antibody to CD16/CD32 (1:500, Biolegend) for 10 min at 4°C. Mouse cortical neuron cultures from P1 pups were used to quantify editing at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Pten-3 (referred to hereafter as “Pten”) produced greater editing overall and was, therefore, selected for use in subsequent assays.It is worth noting that although DNA editing efficiency was low for the Pten-1 species, its minimal disruption in the Pten locus was sufficient to cause a significant decrease in protein expression.
