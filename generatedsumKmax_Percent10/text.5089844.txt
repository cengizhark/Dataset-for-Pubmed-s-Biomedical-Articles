The C-terminal extension of Lsm4 interacts directly with the 3′ end of the histone mRNP and this interaction is required for efficient histone mRNA degradation [13]. ZCCHC11 is the terminal uridylyl transferase responsible for human histone mRNA uridylation following inhibition or completion of DNA replication [14] (Table 1 and Figure 1). Multiple oligouridylation events may be required for 3′–5′ degradation of histone mRNAs on polyribosomes [16]. In human somatic cells, Lin28 is not expressed and the nucleotidyl transferases TUT7, TUT4, and TUT2 monouridylate pre-let-7; this converts pre-let-7 with a 1 nt 3′ overhang to a better Dicer substrate with a 2 nt 3′ overhang and thus enhances dicer processing [69] (Table 1 and Figure 1).Related to the function of triggering degradation, pre-miRNA uridylation also plays a role in pre-miRNA quality control. 2 3′ Adenylation affects RNA synthesis and degradation 2.2 Adenylation of mRNAIn eukaryotic cells, the cotranscriptional addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3′ ends of mRNA molecules is nearly universal; the poly(A) tail protects mRNAs from degradation and facilitates their translation from yeast to higher eukaryotes [1]. Pre-mRNA degradation may represent a secondary role for RNA adenylation in mammals. Following the oligouridylation event, the heteroheptameric Lsm1–7 complex binds to the oligo(U) tail to trigger subsequent histone mRNA degradation via both 5′–3′ and 3′–5′ RNA decay pathways [10,12]. Uridylation and/or adenylation are universal and conserved RNA modifications that have major impacts on the degradation, synthesis and mode of action of RNAs.
