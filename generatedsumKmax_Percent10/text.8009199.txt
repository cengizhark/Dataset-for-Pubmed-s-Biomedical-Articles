2 and 3 present the kinematic viscosity and density values obtained for each material. 3.3Chemiluminescence-based NO analysisPrevious reports have demonstrated that different physiological responses are observed at particular instantaneous NO concentrations. At a concentration of 1.72 % w/w, the NO release calculated for 53 h at physiological temperature was 46 ± 4 μmol g−1 and the total NO content was 58 ± 8 μmol g−1. This heating process causes GSNO to undergo NO-forming decay according to the kinetics illustrated in Fig. This heating process causes GSNO to undergo NO-forming decay according to the kinetics illustrated in Fig. At 53 h the instantaneous release is 53.7 pmol g−1, which is equivalent to 40 nM. Characteristic RSNO absorption peaks were observed at 339 ± 1.5 (π → π*) and 546 ± 0.6 nm (nN → π*). Additionally, the pH was measured over 12 weeks to investigate the stability of the S-nitrosated emulsion. 2.1MaterialsDL-α-Tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E; 97%), n-propyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (99%), methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (99%), 1-hexadecanol (98%), isopropyl tetradecanoate (98%), and triethanolamine (>98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). Glyceryl stearate SE (self emulsifying: glyceryl monostearate with 3–6% potassium stearate) and carbomer 980 QD were procured from MakingCosmetics Inc (Snoqualmie, WA, USA). Adult human dermal fibroblasts (lot # 80616174) were purchased and maintained with fibroblast basal medium (FBM) (lot # 80921174) supplemented with fibroblast growth kit – low serum (lot # 80712184) and penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (lot # 80118182) purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Trypan Blue Solution (lot #RNBD1973) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The NO emission from this process was used to quantify the thermally and photo-releasable NO present in each material. NO release was measured for 53 h in vessels protected from direct exposure to light to prevent further photodecomposition of the RSNO. For the aqueous phase, a 2% w/v solution of carbomer 980 QD was prepared in ultrapure water at room temperature 24 h prior to the emulsification. The following day, ultrapure water was heated to 75 °C and 79.7 mL was added to glycerol (3 g), triethanolamine (0.9 g), methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (0.1 g), and carbomer 980 QD 2 % w/v in ultrapure water (5 g). The process was followed by the addition of GSNO (88.4 mg) to obtain a 1.72 % w/w concentration. Glycerol was included as a humectant that functions to attract water and draw additional moisture into the epidermis,36 while methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate was added as a preservative. This phase of the lotion moisturizes because of the added occlusive agents isopropyl tetradecanoate and mineral oil.
