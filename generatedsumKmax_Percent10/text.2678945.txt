While a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in mTRPA1-transfected cells revealed activation at concentrations below 100 μM menthol, Ca2+ levels declined in a concentration-dependent manner above 100 μM. 2B, left panel, green trace). However, many of these sensory chemicals have been shown to be promiscuous, affecting more than one thermoTRP. The Region Spanning Transmembrane Domain 5 and Transmembrane Domain 6 (TM5-TM6) Determines the Distinct Sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to MentholTo systematically identify the molecular basis underlying the distinct sensitivity of mTRPA1 and hTRPA1 to menthol, we constructed chimeras between the two channels. In contrast, hTRPA1-mTM1-6, a chimera constructed by introducing the transmembrane region from mTRPA1 into hTRPA1 (Fig. Human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) and Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 (dTRPA1) full length cDNA were cloned in pcDNA5/FRT vector, while TRPA1 from Takifugu (Fugu-TRPA1) and Anopheles gambiae (Mosquito-TRPA1) were cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector. These results were corroborated in FLIPR experiments (Fig. 6B-E and Table 1).Sequence alignment of TRPA1 from different species revealed that TRPA1 from Anopheles gambiae (mosquito-TRPA1) and Takifugu (fugu-TRPA1), like dTRPA1, do not have Ser and Thr at these two positions (Fig. On the other hand, the responses of these mutants to ruthenium red, an external pore blocker, and HC030031 remained normal (Table 1).We further tested AP18 on mTRPA1 and its mutants. The optimized mTRPA1 homology model was used for molecule docking calculations. These modeling results put forward the hypothesis that TM5 contributes directly to a binding pocket. However, the apparent consistencies between experimental and modeling results by no means constitute evidence for binding. Menthol is best known to elicit a cooling sensation in humans (Eccles, 1994). One hypothesis is that the TM5 domain may constitute a binding site for menthol. Our modeling and docking studies reveal a putative menthol-binding site in TM5 regions. A,B, mTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (A,0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (B, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). G, hTRPA1 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell-attached patch configuration (G, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette; 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (H, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). I, J, hTRPA1-dTM5 reveals voltage dependent activation in cell attached patch configuration (I, 0 mM Ca2+ in pipette/ 0 mM Ca2+ ES) and whole cell recordings (J, 0 mM Ca2+ ES/ 0 mM Ca2+ IS). AP18 does not form glutathione adducts as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)ESI-MS spectra of glutathione (GSH) alone (A) or reacted with either MO (B) or AP18 (C). When reacted with MO, glutathione adducts of predicted mass were observed (336 + 99 = 435) (B). When reacted with MO, glutathione adducts of predicted mass were observed (336 + 99 = 435) (B). In most experiments studying menthol block of TRPA1 activation, a Ca2+ containing extracellular saline was used (2 mM Ca2+ ES) which contained (in mM): 136 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In some experiments, the pipette contained 100 nM free Ca2+ buffered by BAPTA (1 mM): 130 methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl2, 0.483 CaCl2, 1 BAPTA-K salt, 10 hemi Na-HEPES (pH7.3 with CsOH).TRPA1 activity was usually monitored using repetitive voltage ramps (at 5 sec intervals) in the whole cell configuration. To quantify the effects of TRPA1 modulators on TRPA1 activity, averaged inward currents at -120 mV and averaged (over the first ∼5 msec) outward currents at +120 mV were measured (see Fig. Cells in whole cell configuration were challenged with a voltage step protocol to investigate the current-voltage relationship for TRPA1 activation by voltage. Prior to rupturing the patch to achieve a whole cell recording, voltage protocols were applied to the cell-attached patch and voltage-dependent activation of TRPA1 channel activity was monitored (Supplementary Fig. Briefly, equimolar concentrations of TRPA1 modulators and glutathione (Sigma) were mixed in water and reacted at room temperature for two hours. The complex was subject to molecular dynamics simulation under periodic boundary conditions (90 Å × 90 Å × 100 Å). That was followed by 150 ps of constant volume and subsequent 1 ns of constant pressure molecular dynamics (MD) run at 310 K. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained via the SHAKE algorithm. Farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). For preparing stock solutions, trinitrophenol and ruthenium red were dissolved in H2O. Mutating specific cytoplasmic cysteine residues markedly impaired the sensitivity of TRPA1 to those reactive compounds. Menthol activated hTRPA1 (Fig.
