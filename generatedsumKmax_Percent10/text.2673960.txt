We found several molecules expressed at higher or lower levels in the absence of DAP12 signaling. In humans, mutation of either DAP12 or TREM-2 results in PLOSL (also known as Nasu-Hakola syndrome), a rare disease characterized by presenile dementia, bone cysts, and impaired osteoclast differentiation (15, 25, 45). Upon engagement of DAP12-associated receptors, the tyrosine residues in theDAP12 ITAM are phosphorylated, leading to the recruitment and activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Syk and ZAP70,which in turn lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (20). Antibody against CD18 (GAME-46) was purchased from Santa Cruz and used at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against mouse YM1 were a gift from G. Krystal, rat antibody against the mannose receptor (5D3) was from L. Martinez-Pomares. ThioMΦs and BMMs were isolated as described (11). We used the PKH26 Red Fluorescence Cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the supplied instructions. FACS analysisResident peritoneal cell suspensions were collected by peritoneal lavage with PBS. Cells were blocked (0.5% BSA, 2 mM NaN3, 5 mM EDTA, 5% goat serum, 5% rabbit serum) and incubated on ice with primary antibodies at 10 µg/ml. The specificity of antibody binding and secondary reagents was monitored through the use of isotype-matched control antibodies (IgG2b for 5C6, IgG1 for DECMA-1). Frozen tissue sections were thawed at room temperature, fixed in 2% PFA in Hepes-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, quenched with glucose oxidase, blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with antibodies against EMR1, CD68, MARCO, and mannose receptor (10 µg/ml). Gels were renatured in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in 200 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 µM ZnCl2 for gelatin zymography or in 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0 for casein zymography at 37°C and stained with Coomassie blue. Western blot analysisCells were lysed in protein lysis buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1 mM Na3VO4, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche)] and lysates were loaded onto 10% SDS gels. One fusogenic clone was selected and recloned. Cloning and transfectionMurine DAP12 cDNA was amplified with the following primers: Forward primer AAGCTAGCCCGCCATGGGGGCTCTGGAGCCCTCC, reverse primer AACACACAGAGGCAATATTACCAGTCGACAA and cloned into pEYFP-N1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, US) via the NheI and SalI site. This phenotype is based on impaired osteoclast differentiation and function (15, 25). Stable transfectants were selected by prolonged culture in medium containing G418 at 600 to 1000 µg/ml. Preparation of human macrophagesHuman monocytes were isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors (Bristol Blood Donor Services). DAP12-deficient mice have been generated either by partial gene deletion (16, 26) or by mutation of the DAP12 gene, leading to expression of a nonfunctional version of the DAP12 protein (27). Implantation of biomaterialsAll procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University. Implants were excised en bloc at 2 and 4weeks after implantation and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis according to standard protocols. Macrophage cultures were analyzed in greater detail by staining with Hemacolor. Because silencing of DAP12 was induced after macrophage maturation, the data also show that the fusion defect is not mediated by deficient macrophage maturation. Fetal liver–derived macrophages (FLDMs) from Syk-KO embryos (36) were stimulated with IL-4 and GM-CSF to induce macrophage fusion.
