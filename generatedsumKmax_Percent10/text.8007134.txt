Participants reporting a race other than Hispanic/Latino/Spanish, African American/black or Caucasian/white were excluded from the analyses (n=36; Table 1).Firstly, to assess the possible additive effects of experiencing multiple indicators of social disadvantage/marginalisation, the number of specified syndemic conditions was summed for participants at each time-point (i.e., ranging from zero to four) and included in a GEE analysis with sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours as the dependent variable, controlling for age, race and last partner type (i.e., main/regular partner, friend/acquaintance, or one-time/unknown/’trade’ partner).Secondly, we constructed multivariate GEE models (using an exchangeable correlation structure due to the underlying assumption that outcomes from the same subject are correlated over follow-up) to explore associations between exposures and outcomes over the follow-up period and generate profiles of participants classified as experiencing high levels of social disadvantage/marginalisation (i.e., a greater number of syndemic conditions). The same GEE model was conducted alternating each of the syndemic conditions and involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours as the dependent variable, and controlling for age, HIV status, race, key drug use variables significant at a bivariate level, and last partner type. Multivariate analyses: Number of syndemic conditions reported vs. key outcomesTable 2 shows that, when controlling for participant age and race and last partner type, reporting a greater number (i.e., two or more) of structural syndemic conditions was significantly associated with reporting sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among HIV-negative respondents [two conditions: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.30; ≥3 conditions: AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.37), and having a DVL among the HIV-positive group (vs. not having a DVL) (two conditions: AOR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11–1.42; ≥3 conditions: 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09–1.52). Our study did point to an additive effect in that experiencing more structural syndemic conditions was associated with significantly higher odds of both HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants engaging in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours with their last anal sex partner, and of HIV-positive participants having a DVL. However, race was not significantly associated with any other outcomes, suggesting that experience of the structural disparities investigated in this research is an important contributor to involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among MCSM generally. Further analyses showed that this finding was not dictated by age or any particular race (data not shown), suggesting that additional barriers are preventing such men from accessing appropriate professional support.
