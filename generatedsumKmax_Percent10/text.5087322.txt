For example, a peak with a m/z ratio of 761 corresponding to anti-BPDE-EGCG complex was found in the anti-BPDE–EGCG reaction mixture; the MS/MS spectrum of the complex further suggested a direct covalent interaction of anti-BPDE and EGCG (data not shown). The peaks with retention times of 8.51, 9.56, 10.17, 11.30, 11.47, 11.66, and 11.96 all generated a fragmentation pattern in which a fragment with a m/z ratio of 591 and another fragment with a m/z ratio of 303 exist, suggesting that anti-BPDE attacks the hydroxyl groups on the B ring of EGCG molecules (Figure 6B). The peaks with retention times of 10.51 and 10.59 min generated a different fragmentation pattern in which a fragment with a m/z ratio of 455 and another fragment with a m/z ratio of 307 exist, suggesting that anti-BPDE attacks the hydroxyl groups on the D ring of EGCG molecules (Figure 6C). The hydroxyl groups on either the B ring or the D ring of EGCG molecules (Figure 6B,C), but not both, were found to react with anti-BPDE, thus sequestering anti-BPDE. Our MS studies on the anti-BPDE–EGCG complex did not provide information on the exact position of the hydroxyl groups that react with anti-BPDE. This is probably because anti-BPDE has two optical enantiomers, and also, anti-BPDE can attack different positions on the B ring or D ring of EGCG molecules, which produce different complexes with different retention times as shown in our results. Back in the early 1980s, Conney and co-workers showed that the plant phenolic ellagic acid was highly potent in inhibiting the mutagenesis by anti-BPDE (34). Subsequently, this group demonstrated that this inhibition occurred due to covalent interaction of ellagic acid with anti-BPDE (35). Green tea extract, which contains several catechins with cis-diol groups, like in ellagic acid, was reported to decrease anti-BPDE-induced DNA strand breaks (37), presumably by the same mechanistic action of ellagic acid reported by Sayer et al  (35). MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired in positive ion mode at 30000 mass resolution.
