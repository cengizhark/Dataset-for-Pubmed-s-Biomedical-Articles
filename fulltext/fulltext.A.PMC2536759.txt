Introduction
The apoptotic response of cells is induced by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways that confer downstream activation of the caspase cysteine proteases. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by ligand stimulation of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) receptor superfamily of death receptors. These death receptors include, among others, TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1), Fas (CD95), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors 1 (TRAIL-R1/DR4) and 2 (TRAIL-R2/DR5). A death domain (DD) of 60-70 amino acids is shared by these receptors and is necessary for the induction of apoptosis (1). TNFα stimulation of TNF-R1 induces the formation of a cell membrane complex with the adaptor TRADD, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) that leads to the activation of NF-κB and cell survival (2). Alternatively, TRADD and RIP1 associate with FADD and caspase-8 (2, 3). In turn, activation of caspase-8 results in the cleavage of procaspase-3 and the induction of apoptosis (4-6). Caspase-8 also cleaves Bid, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and thereby induces release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, into the cytosol (7, 8). Stimulation of Fas with Fas ligand (FasL) or TRAIL-R1/2 receptors with TRAIL induces the recruitment of FADD and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (9). Recruitment of caspase-8 by FADD through their death effector domains (DEDs) is associated with dimerization of caspase-8, interdimer cleavage to the active caspase-8 p18/p10 fragments and the apoptotic response.
The human MUC1 mucin-type glycoprotein is expressed at the apical plasma membranes of normal secretory epithelial cells (10). MUC1 is translated as a single polypeptide that undergoes autoproteolysis into two subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (11-13). The MUC1 N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) is the mucin component with variable numbers of 20 amino acid tandem repeats that are modified by O-glycosylation (14, 15). MUC1-N forms a stable heterodimer with the MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) at the cell membrane and extends beyond the glycocalyx as part of a physical barrier that protects the epithelial cell surface. With transformation and loss of polarity, MUC1 is aberrantly expressed at high levels on the entire surface of carcinoma cells (10). Overexpression of MUC1 in transformed cells is also associated with accumulation of MUC1-C in the cytosol and targeting of this subunit to the nucleus (16-21) and mitochondria (22-24). MUC1-C consists of a 58 amino acid extracellular domain, a 28 amino acid transmembrane domain and a 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (25). The MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) functions as a substrate for c-Src (26), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (27), protein kinase Cδ(28) and c-Abl (29). MUC1-CD also interacts directly with the Wnt effector β-catenin (20, 24, 26-28, 30), the p53 tumor suppressor (18), estrogen receptor α (19), IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and IKKγ(31).
Overexpression of MUC1 as found in human carcinomas and certain hematologic malignancies induces transformation and resistance to apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents, reactive oxygen species and hypoxia (16, 18, 20, 22, 29, 32-34). The present results demonstrate that MUC1-C binds directly to caspase-8 and FADD, blocks recruitment of caspase-8 and thereby prevents activation of the death receptor-induced extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Material and Methods
Cell cultureHuman HCT116 colon cancer cells expressing an empty vector or MUC1 (22) and human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Mediatech), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (ATCC, Manasses, VA). Human BC-1 lymphoma and U-937 leukemia cells were grown in RPMI-640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics and L-glutamine. Human MCF-10A breast epithelial cells were grown in mammary epithelial cell growth media (MEGM; Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Cells were treated with TRAIL (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), Flag-tagged TRAIL (Axxora, San Diego, CA), TNFα (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and FasL (CH11; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY).
Silencing of MUC1 and FADD expressionThe BLOCK-iT Target Screening System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to generate siRNAs that target two MUC1 sequences (#1, AAGGTACCATCAATGTCCACG; or #2, AAGTTCAGTGCCCAGCTCTAC) and a control sequence (CGCTTACCGATTCAGAATGG). The RNAi cassettes were transferred to pLenti4/BLOCK-iT-DEST by LR recombination for the generation of lentiviral vectors. BC-1 cells were infected with the lentiviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Cell clones were selected in methylcellulose semi-solid medium containing 200 μg/ml Zeocin and assayed for downregulation of MUC1 by immunoblotting. Transient transfection of the MCF-10A cells with control, MUC1 siRNA or FADD siRNA pools (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was performed in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000.
Stable expression of MUC1-C in U-937 cellsPT67 cells were transfected with pLXIN or pLXIN-MUC1-C and selected in the presence of G418. Supernatants were filtered, assayed for retroviral titers using NIH3T3 cells and used for infection of U-937 cells. At 24 h after infection, the cells were seeded into methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and single cell clones were selected in G418.
Immunoprecipitation, DISC isolation and immunoblot analysisCells were lysed by sonication in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-caspase-8 (Axxora; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by precipitation with protein A/G beads (Pierce Biotechnologies, Rockford, IL). In certain experiments, cells were incubated with the complex of Flag-tagged TRAIL and anti-Flag (M2; Sigma), and then lysates were immunoprecipitated with protein-G-sepharose to isolate DISC complexes as described (35). Immune complexes and lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MUC1-C (LabVision, Fremont, CA), anti-caspase-8, anti-β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-His (Invitrogen), anti-GST (EMD Biosciences, LaJolla, CA), mouse anti-FADD (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) and rabbit anti-FADD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Reactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
In vitro caspase-8 activity assayCaspase-8 activity was assayed using the BD ApoAlert Caspase-8 Colorimetric Assay Kit and IETD-pNA(p-nitroaniline) as substrate (BD Bioscience). Caspase-8 activity was monitored at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer.
In vitro binding assaysPurified GST, GST-MUC1-CD(1-72), GST-MUC1-CD deletion mutants, GST-caspase-8, GST-caspase-8 deletion mutants, GST-FADD, GST-N-FADD and GST-C-FADD (36) were purified from E. coli (BL21 DE3) and immobilized on glutathione beads (Pierce). His-MUC1-CD(1-72) and His-caspase-8 deletion mutants were purified on Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). GST and GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads were incubated with purified soluble proteins for 2 h at 4°C, washed and the adsorbates analyzed by immunoblotting. For competition studies, GST-caspase-8 DED bound to FADD was incubated with increasing amounts of MUC1-CD. Precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. In certain studies, binding was performed in the presence of a synthetic peptide (CQCRRKNYGQLDIFPARDTY) derived from amino acids 1-20 from MUC1-CD (Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute).
Apoptosis assaysCells were fixed in 70% ethanol and incubated in PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase and 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA was determined by the MODFIT LT Program (Verity Software, Topsham, ME). Cells were also suspended in Annexin-V-FLOUS containing propidium iodide (Roche) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
MUC1 attenuates death receptor-induced activation of caspase-8To determine whether MUC1 regulates death receptor signaling, we infected BC-1 cells with a lentivirus expressing a siRNA that targets the MUC1 sequence 5′-AAGGTACCATCAATGTCCACG-3′ encoding amino acids in MUC1-C (MUC1siRNA#1). As compared to BC-1 cells infected with a lentivirus expressing a control siRNA (CsiRNA), MUC1-C expression was stably downregulated by the MUC1siRNA#1 (Fig. 1A). To avoid potential off-target effects, we also infected the BC-1 cells with a lentivirus expressing a siRNA that targets a different MUC1 sequence encoding amino acids in MUC1-N (5′-AAGTTCAGTGCCCAGCTCTAC-3′; MUC1siRNA#2). Downregulation of MUC1-C was similar with the two MUC1siRNAs (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the BC-1/CsiRNA cells with FasL had little effect on activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 1B). By contrast, FasL treatment of BC-1 cells silenced for MUC1 was associated with cleavage of caspase-8 to the p18 fragment (Fig. 1B). To determine if silencing MUC1 affects death receptor-induced apoptosis, BC-1/CsiRNA and BC-1/MUC1siRNA cells were treated with FasL and then monitored for sub-G1 DNA content. In concert with the inhibitory effects of MUC1 on caspase-8 activation, silencing MUC1 sensitized BC-1 cells to FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). The inhibitory effect of MUC1 on the apoptotic response to FasL was confirmed in repeated experiments with BC-1 cells expressing MUC1siRNA#1 and MUC1siRNA#2 (Fig. 1D) and in cells stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (Supplemental Fig. S1). Previous work showed that MUC1 blocks TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cancer cells (22). Consistent with the results obtained using BC-1 cells, TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 in HCT116 cells was blocked by a MUC1-dependent mechanism (Supplemental Fig. S2). These findings indicate that MUC1 attenuates death receptor-induced activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis.
MUC1-C is sufficient to block death receptor-induced signalingTo determine if the MUC1-C subunit is sufficient to block activation of caspase-8, we stably transfected MUC1-negative U-937 cells with an empty vector or MUC1-C (Fig. 2A). Treatment of the U-937/vector cells with TNFα was associated with activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 2B). By contrast, this response to TNFα was attenuated in U-937/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when the U-937/vector and U-937/MUC1-C cells were stimulated with FasL (Supplemental Fig. S3). Moreover, expression of MUC1-C abrogated sensitivity to TNFα- and FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2C). These responses were confirmed with both U-937/MUC1-C clones and in repeated experiments (Fig. 2D), and using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (Supplemental Fig. S4). These findings indicate that MUC1-C is sufficient to block death receptor-induced activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis.
MUC1-C inhibits caspase-8 in the response of nontransformed MCF-10A cells to death ligand stimulationInhibition of caspase-8 by MUC1-C could represent a response in nontransformed cells that is constitutively activated by overexpression of MUC1 in malignant cells. To address this possibility, studies were performed on the nontransformed MCF-10A cells (37, 38), which express endogenous MUC1 but at lower levels than that found in carcinoma cells (31). Treatment of MCF-10A cells with TRAIL had little if any effect on activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 3A, left). To assess the effects of MUC1 in the MCF-10A cells, we downregulated MUC1 with a MUC1siRNA pool, which for transient silencing was more effective than with the lentiviruses. TRAIL treatment of the MCF-10A cells with MUC1 silencing was associated with cleavage of caspase-8 to the p18 fragment (Fig. 3A, left). The inhibitory effects of MUC1 were confirmed by direct measurement of caspase-8 activity (Fig. 3A, right). Silencing MUC1 in MCF-10A cells was also associated with activation of caspase-8 in response to TNFα (Fig. 3B) and FasL (Fig. 3C) stimulation. Notably, the results from coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that MUC1-C and caspase-8 associate at a low level constitutively and that, this interaction is induced by death receptor stimulation (Fig. 3D). In addition, binding of MUC1-C and caspase-8 was detectable constitutively in BC-1, U-937 and HCT116 cells (Supplemental Fig. S5A-C), indicating that this interaction is found in diverse cell types. These findings indicated that MUC1 associates with caspase-8 and contributes to the physiologic regulation of caspase-8 activation.
MUC1-CD binds directly to caspase-8MUCl-C includes a 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (CD) that interacts with β-catenin, IKKs and multiple kinases (Fig. 4A, upper panel). To determine whether MUC1-CD interacts directly with caspase-8, we incubated purified His-tagged MUC1-CD with GST or GST-caspase-8 immobilized on glutathione beads. Immunoblot analysis of adsorbates with anti-His showed that MUC1-CD binds to caspase-8 (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Caspase-8 consists of an N-terminal region with two DEDs (amino acids 1-183), and the p18 (amino acids 217-374) and pl0 (amino acids 385-480) cleavage products (Fig. 4B, upper panel). To define the region of caspase-8 that interacts with MUCl-CD, we incubated GST fusion proteins of caspase-8 fragments with His-MUC1-CD. Analysis of the adsorbates demonstrated that MUC1-CD binds to the region (amino acids 184-384) that includes caspase-8-p18 (Fig. 4B, lower panels). To further define the sequences in caspase-8-p18 that are responsible for the interaction, we generated His-tagged fragments designated A (amino acids 184-269), B (amino acids 270-322), C (amino acids 323-384) and AB (amino acids 184-322) (Fig. 4C, upper panel). Incubation of the His-caspase-8-p18 fragments with GST-MUC1-CD demonstrated that MUC1-CD binds to caspase-8-p18-B (amino acids 270-322) (Fig. 4C, lower panels and Supplemental Fig. S6). Additional binding studies with His-caspase-8(184-384) and GST-MUC1-CD fragments showed that MUC1-CD amino acids 1-20 confer the interaction with caspase-8 (Fig. 4D, upper). Moreover, binding of MUC1-CD(1-20) to caspase-8-p18 was attenuated by incubation in the presence of a synthetic MUC1-CD(1-20) peptide (Fig. 4D, lower). These findings demonstrate that MUC1-CD binds directly to caspase-8-p18.
MUC1-C blocks recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISCBinding of TRAIL to DR4/5 results in recruitment of FADD to the DISC and, in turn, FADD recruits caspase-8 (39). To determine if MUC1-C affects DISC function, MCF-10A cells were treated with a complex of Flag-tagged TRAIL and anti-Flag to precipitate the DISC. Silencing MUC1 had no effect on DR4/5 levels in the DISC (Fig. 5A). Silencing MUC1 also had little effect on TRAIL-induced recruitment of FADD (Fig. 5A). Notably, however, TRAIL treatment was associated with recruitment of MUC1-C to the DISC (Fig. 5A). We also found that MUC1 attenuates recruitment of caspase-8 (Fig. 5A). These results thus indicated that MUC1-C is recruited to the DISC by a mechanism independent of its interaction with caspase-8. To determine whether the recruitment of MUC1-C is dependent on FADD, the MCF-10A cells were silenced for FADD and then treated with TRAIL. Recruitment of MUC1-C to the DISC was attenuated by silencing FADD (Fig. 5B). The results of coimmunoprecipitation studies further demonstrated that TRAIL induces the formation of MUC1-C-FADD complexes (Fig. 5C). Moreover, in MCF-7 cancer cells, we found that MUC1-C associates with FADD at high levels constitutively and that this interaction is modestly increased in the response to TRAIL (Fig. 5D). These findings indicated that MUC1-C interacts with FADD.
MUC1-CD binds directly to the FADD DEDTo determine whether MUC1-C binds to FADD, we incubated GST-MUC1-CD or GST-MUC1-CD deletion mutants with purified FADD. Analysis of the adsorbates demonstrated that MUC1-CD and FADD interact directly (Fig. 6A). We also found that MUC1-CD(46-72), and not MUC1-CD(1-45), binds to FADD (Fig. 6A). FADD consists of a DD that binds to DR4/5 and a DED that recruits caspase-8 to the DISC (Fig. 6B, upper panel). To define the region of FADD that confers the interaction, we incubated GST-FADD or GST-FADD deletion mutants (Fig. 6B, upper panel) with purified MUC1-CD. These binding studies confirmed the direct interaction between MUC1-CD and FADD and further demonstrated that, like caspase-8, MUC1-CD interacts with the FADD DED and not the DD (Fig. 6B, lower panel). Importantly, in competition experiments, incubation of GST-caspase-8(1-183) with FADD and then increasing amounts of MUC1-CD was associated with a progressive decrease in the interaction between FADD and caspase-8(1-183) (Fig. 6C), indicating that caspase-8 and MUC1-CD compete for binding to FADD. These findings indicate that FADD forms mutually exclusive complexes with MUC1-CD and caspase-8.
Discussion
MUC1 blocks death receptor-induced activation of caspase-8Previous work had shown that overexpression of MUC1 in HCT116 cells inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis (22). These findings were attributed to localization of MUC1-C to the mitochondrial outer membrane with a block in Bid-induced release of apoptogenic factors and thereby the extrinsic pathway (22). However, the present results demonstrate that MUC1 blocks TRAIL-induced signaling upstream to Bid by inhibiting caspase-8 activation. MUC1 also blocked TNFα- and FasL-induced activation of caspase-8 to the p18 fragment. In concert with these results, MUC1 blocked death receptor-induced apoptosis in diverse cell models. In addition, MUC1-C was sufficient for blocking caspase-8 activation and the apoptotic response, indicating that the MUC1-N mucin component is dispensable for inhibition of the extrinsic pathway. Previous studies of COS7 cells expressing a CD8/MUC1 fusion protein and CHO cells expressing a hamster Muc1 showed an augmentation of FasL-induced activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis (40). The basis for the discrepancy of those and the present results are not clear, but may relate to the expression of a MUC1 fusion protein that affects MUC1 function or the upregulation of Fas in these models. In this regard, MUC1 had little if any effect on Fas expression in the present studies. Moreover, our findings obtained with human malignant cells with and without MUC1 expression clearly show that MUC1 suppresses induction of both caspase-8 activity and apoptosis in the response to activation of diverse death receptors with FasL, TRAIL and TNFα.
MUC1-C binds directly to caspase-8The long form of the caspase-8 (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein (cFLIPL) has two DEDs that confer binding to the caspase-8-p18 region (amino acids 217-374) (41). The present results demonstrate that, like cFLIPL, MUC1-C interacts directly with caspase-8-p18 (amino acids 270-322) and that this interaction is conferred by amino acids 1-20 of MUC1-CD (Fig. 6D). Mutation of the two cysteines in MUC1-CD had no effect on binding of to caspase-8-p18, indicating that the interaction is not mediated by disulfide bonds. Caspase-8-p18 contains the catalytic Cys-360 residue that is directly inhibited by the p35 protein from baculovirus (42). Our results indicate that MUC1-CD binds upstream to Cys-360. Moreover, unlike p35, incubation of active recombinant caspase-8 with stoichiometric concentrations of MUC1-CD in vitro had little effect on caspase-8 activity (data not shown). Homodimerization of caspase-8 results in interdimer processing to the p18 and p10 fragments that form active caspase-8 (43). Binding of cFLIP to caspase-8 blocks caspase-8 dimerization and the processing of caspase-8 to the p18 and p10 fragments (44). Binding of MUC1-C to the p18 region of caspase-8 could thus also interfere with interdimer processing and thereby prevent caspase-8 activation. In other studies, caspase-8 has been linked to activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB (44-47). In this context, recent work has shown that MUC1-C interacts with IKKβ/IKKγ and activates NF-κB signaling (31). However, it is presently not known if the interaction between MUC1-C and caspase-8 contributes to MUC1-C-mediated activation of the IKK->NF-κB pathway.
MUC1-C blocks recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISCActivation of TNF-R1 results in binding to TRADD and then the recruitment of FADD (2). The activated Fas and DR4/5 receptors directly bind FADD through their DDs (9). Significantly, the present results demonstrate that MUC1-C is recruited to the DISC and that this response is dependent on FADD (Fig. 6D). We also found that MUC1-CD binds directly to the FADD DED. In concert with these results, MUC1-C blocks recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC and MUC1-CD competes with caspase-8 for binding to the FADD DED in vitro. Direct binding studies further showed that MUC1-CD(46-72) confers the interaction with FADD. cFLIP competes with caspase-8 for recruitment to the DISC (41, 48-50). Thus, the demonstration that MUC1-C behaves like cFLIP by interacting with the FADD DED and blocking caspase-8 recruitment indicates that MUC1-C and cFLIP have redundant functions (Fig. 6D). However, MUC1-C is devoid of a DED and the same region of MUC1-CD that binds to FADD also interacts with β-catenin (30), IKKγ (31) and the HSP90/HSP70 complex (23, 24). These findings and the present results with FADD indicate that MUC1-C has multiple unrelated binding partners and therefore may have a chaperone-like function. MUC1-C also functions as a transmembrane receptor and thus would potentially represent a novel class of chaperone.
Binding of MUC1-C to FADD and caspase-8 is a physiologic responseMalignant cells could exploit a physiologic function of MUC1 through aberrant expression of this protein. For example, studies in MCF-10A cells demonstrated little constitutive interaction between MUC1-C and FADD or caspase-8. However, death receptor stimulation was associated with increased binding of MUC1-C to both FADD and caspase-8. Moreover, MUC1 attenuated death receptor-induced activation of caspase-8 in the MCF-10A cells. Thus, expression of MUC1 by normal epithelial cells may activate a physiological response involving inhibition of caspase-8 activation as a protective mechanism. In this regard, epithelial cells that are exposed to inflammatory conditions could utilize MUC1-dependent attenuation of caspase-8 to transiently protect against death in response to local release of TNFα, TRAIL or FasL by immune effector cells. In contrast to nonmalignant cells, MUC1 is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas and certain hematologic malignancies (10, 51, 52). The present findings indicate that overexpression of MUC1 as found in human tumors is of importance to attenuation of caspase-8 activation in response to death receptor stimulation and that MUC1-mediated inhibition of this pathway may have been exploited by malignant cells for survival under adverse conditions.
