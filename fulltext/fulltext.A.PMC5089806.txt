1. Introduction
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen (TAM) exert antiproliferative effects in breast cancer by competing with estrogens for binding to estrogen receptor α (ERα), leading to an inhibition of downstream genes, including those involved in breast cancer proliferation. Fulvestrant is a selective ERα downregulator (SERD) because it causes proteasomal degradation of ERα in addition to its SERM-like ability to antagonize estrogen-activated ERα transactivation (Wijayaratne et al., 1999). TAM inhibits cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis (Mandlekar and Kong, 2001; Salami and Karami-Tehrani, 2003). TAM has greatly increased the survival rate of breast cancer patients since its initial FDA approval in 1977, resulting in a 31% reduction in annual death rate (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative, 2005; Jordan, 2009). Despite the initial efficacy of SERM and aromatase inhibitor treatment, approximately 40% of patients relapse and die from metastatic disease because the cancer cells become refractory to endocrine therapies (Ring and Dowsett, 2004).
The mechanisms for acquired endocrine resistance are complex and a better understanding of maintenance of endocrine sensitivity is clearly needed. Reduced expression of the orphan nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) has a demonstrated role in acquired endocrine resistance in a breast cancer cell line model of human disease progression (Riggs et al., 2006). Restoration of COUP-TFII expression, which is reduced in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cell lines, inhibited cell proliferation and motility and increased apoptosis in TAM and fulvestrant-treated endocrine-resistant LCC9 and LY2 breast cancer cells (Riggs et al., 2006). Conversely, inhibition of COUP-TFII expression caused MCF-7 cells to become resistant to SERM and fulvestrant inhibition of proliferation (Riggs et al., 2006). A mechanism for the involvement of COUP-TFII in maintenance of endocrine sensitivity has not yet been determined. Since COUP-TFII acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor in a gene- and cell-specific manner (Litchfield and Klinge, 2012), the mechanism of action may involve modulation of specific target genes including tumor suppressors and oncogenes.
The NFκB family of dimeric transcription factors have important functions related to immune and inflammatory responses, and recent studies have demonstrated NFκB activation plays a role in acquired endocrine-resistant breast cancer (Gu et al., 2002; Nehra et al., 2010; Riggins et al., 2005). Inactive NFκB is located in the cytoplasm bound to IκB, the inhibitor of NFκB. Also present in the cytoplasm is the IKK complex containing the regulatory subunit NEMO (nuclear factor-κB essential modulator or IKKγ) and the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ. Upon activation by a variety of stimuli, the IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor IκB leading to its degradation, freeing the now activated NFκB to translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription. Because NFκB activation results in expression of genes that lead to antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative activities, increased NFκB signaling promotes cancer cell survival (Perkins, 2007).
Dysregulation of the NFκB subunits p65 (RELA), RelB (RELB), p50 (NFKB1), p52 (NFKB2), and c-Rel (REL) results in altered activation of the NFκB pathway in breast cancer. Increased expression of p50/NFκB1, p52/NFκB2, and c-Rel was detected in breast tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue (Cogswell et al., 2000). Elevated p50/NFκB1-DNA binding correlated with metastatic relapse and reduced disease-free survival in patients with ERα-positive tumors (Zhou et al., 2005a,b). An increase in NFκB activity has been reported in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells (Gu et al., 2002; Nehra et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2007). p65/RelA level was also elevated (Nehra et al., 2010). The expression and DNA binding of p50 and p65 are also enhanced in LCC1 estrogen-independent, TAM-sensitive breast cancer cells compared to MCF-7 estrogen-dependent cells, further demonstrating a role for NFκB in the pathway to endocrine resistance (Pratt et al., 2003).
Since COUP-TFII expression is decreased in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, we hypothesized COUP-TFII may play a part in the normal suppression of NFκB activity in endocrine-sensitive breast cancer cells by regulating the transcription of components of the NFκB pathway. In this study, we observed that COUP-TFII overexpression inhibited NFκB activity in LCC9 endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. This suppression of the NFκB pathway resulted in reduced expression of downstream NFκB target genes as well as NFκB subunits and increased sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment. Our results provide a mechanism by which COUP-TFII maintains endocrine sensitivity by suppressing NFκB expression and activity in breast cancer cells.

LCC9 are ERα/progesterone receptor (PR)+, multi-antiestrogen (tamoxifen and fulvestrant)- resistant breast cells derived from MCF-7 cells and were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke (Brunner et al., 1997). MCF-7 and LCC9 cells were maintained as in (Riggs et al., 2006). Cells were transiently transfected as indicated in figure legends using FuGENE HD (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.4. Luciferase assayTo analyze NFκB activity, MCF-7 and LCC9 cells were transiently transfected with pGL4.32[luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro] (Promega, Madison, WI) containing five copies of a NFκB response element, pGL4-hRluc-TK (Renilla, Promega), and pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3. 1-mCOUP-TFII (kindly provided by Drs. Sophia and Ming-Jer Tsai (Qiu et al., 1995)) for 48 h before performing dual luciferase assay (Promega). Where indicated, cotransfection was performed with plasmids for CBP (kindly provided by Dr. Margarita Hadzopoulou-Cladaras (Dell and Hadzopoulou-Cladaras, 1999)), SRC-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Bert W. O’Malley (Lanz et al., 1999)), GRIP1/SRC-2, or ACTR/SRC-3 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Stallcup (Koh et al., 2001)).
2.5. NFκB pathway PCR arrayLCC9 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3. 1-mCOUP-TFII for 24 h before treating with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h. RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cDNA was prepared using RT2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences/Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Human NFκB Signaling Pathway PCR Array (SABiosciences/Qiagen) was run according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2.6. NFκB family DNA-binding assaysMCF-7 or LCC9 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-COUP-TFII for 48 h and treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h before preparing nuclear extract (NE). In brief, following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma–Aldrich), 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). The cells were lysed with a 27 gauge syringe and centrifuged. The cytosolic extract was removed and the resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in NE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 12.5% glycerol, pH 7.9), 1 mM DTT, 1X protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche)), sonicated, and then sedimented by centrifugation with the resulting supernatant being the NE. Following protein concentration determination (as above), 15 μg NE was used for TransAM NFκB DNA binding ELISA assays (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, NE was added to 8 well strips containing immobilized NFκB RE oligonucleotide. Primary antibodies specific for NFκB subunits RelB, RelA, p50, p52, and c-Rel were used to identify subunit-specific NFκB activation. Secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and provided buffers provided colorimetric quantitation via spectrophotometric analysis at 450 nm.
2.7. Co-immunoprecipitationNuclear extracts were prepared from MCF-7 cells as in (Litchfield et al., 2012). Dynabeads protein A (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were incubated with COUP-TFII antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or negative control IgG (Santa Cruz) for 30 min prior to the addition of 400 μg MCF-7 NE for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. Following washes, protein was eluted with Elution Buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and pH was adjusted with 1 M TrisHCl.
2.8. Cell proliferation assayMCF-7 and LCC9 cells were grown for 48 h in medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CSS) and transfected with pcDNA or pcDNA-mCOUP-TFII for 24 h before treatment with 0.01–5 μM BMS-345541 in DMSO for 5 days. LCC9 cells were also treated with 1 μM 4-OHT 10 ng/ml TNFα. Cell proliferation was assayed using CellTiter AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS; Promega).
2.9. RNA isolation, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time-PCR (qPCR)RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and qPCR were performed as in (Litchfield et al., 2012). The following SYBR green primers were used for qPCR analysis, relative to GAPDH control: RELB (Yun et al., 2011), REL, NFKB1 and NFKB2 (Panguluri et al., 2010), IL6 (Sansone et al., 2007), A20/TNFAIP3 (Vendrell et al., 2007), ICAM1 (Silverman et al., 2001), NR2F2 and GAPDH (More et al., 2003), Nr2f2 (Forward 5′-CCCCCATAGATATGGCAATGGTAGTCAGCACG-3′, Reverse 5′-TTGATTTATTTATTGAATTGCCATATATGGCC-3′). p65/RELA was measured using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems) relative to 18S control.
2.10. Microarray analysisPublished microarray data was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (dataset GSE17705) on primary breast tumors from 298 ERα+ patients treated with tamoxifen for 5 years to correlate genomic markers to relapse free survival (Symmans et al., 2010). We analyzed this dataset to assess the correlation between COUP-TFII (NR2F2) expression and NFκB subunit (NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, RELB) and target gene (ICAM1, IL6, TNFAIP3) expression. Gene expression data was log2 transformed and quantile normalized prior to analysis. Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman Rho (ρS) statistic to assess whether NR2F2 expression was inversely correlated with NFκB subunit/target genes.
2.11. Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed as in (Litchfield et al., 2012).
3. Results
3.1. COUP-TFII suppresses NFκB activityTo determine if NFκB activity is differentially regulated by COUP-TFII in endocrine-sensitive vs. -resistant cells, MCF-7 (sensitive) and LCC9 (resistant) cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing five tandem repeats of a NFκB responsive element as well as pcDNA3.1 parental plasmid or pcDNA3.1-COUP-TFII (Fig. 1A). Transfected LCC9 cells showed ~5-fold higher COUP-TFII expression compared with similarly transfected MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Basal NFκB activity in LCC9 is ~5-fold higher than MCF-7 cells. When treated with TNFα, a large increase in NFκB activity is observed in LCC9 but not MCF-7 cells. A statistically significant, dose-dependent decrease in the TNFα-induced NFκB activation occurs in LCC9 cells upon overexpression of COUP-TFII. These data demonstrate that COUP-TFII suppresses NFκB activity in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. The expression of NFκB subunits NFKB2, REL, and RELB was higher in LCC9 compared to MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B), accounting for the higher NFκB activity in LCC9 cells.
3.2. Identification of effects of COUP-TFII on the expression of genes related to the NFκB-regulated signaling pathwayAn NFκB signaling pathway PCR array was used to determine the effect of COUP-TFII on the expression of 84 genes related to NFκB-mediated signaling in LCC9 endocrine-resistant cells treated with TNFα using a 3-fold cutoff (Supplemental Fig. 2A). As displayed in the resulting heatmap, a general decrease in the expression of NFκB pathway genes was detected with COUP-TFII overexpression (Supplemental Fig. 2B, increased COUP-TFII protein is shown in Supplemental Fig. 2). Among the genes suppressed >3-fold by COUP-TFII were NFκB -responsive genes, i.e., CCL2, IL6, LTA, ICAM1, and TNFAIP3, as well as NFκB subunits (RELB), reflecting a possible role for COUP-TFII in downregulation of the NFκB pathway.
3.3. COUP-TFII suppresses endogenous NFκB target gene expressionTo extend and confirm the results from the NFκB pathway PCR array, MCF-7 and LCC9 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-COUP-TFII and treated with TNFα to determine the effect of COUP-TFII on endogenous NFκB target gene expression. COUP-TFII expression following transient transfection was verified via western blot (Supplemental Fig. 1). Three NFκB target genes with known roles in breast cancer progression were examined through qPCR to validate the results from the NFκB pathway PCR array: interleukin 6 (IL6), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and TNFα-induced protein 3 (A20, TNFAIP3) (Fig. 2). Higher basal levels of IL6 and TNFAIP3 transcripts were observed in LCC9 compared to MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Fig. 3). TNFα increased the expression of IL6, ICAM1, and TNFAIP3 in both cell lines (Fig. 2A–C). COUP-TFII overexpression reduced the basal expression of IL6 in LCC9 cells (Fig. 2A) and ICAM1 and TNFAIP3 in both MCF-7 and LCC9 cells (Fig. 2B and C). The TNFα-induction of IL6 and ICAM1 was reduced by COUP-TFII in LCC9 cells (Fig. 2A and B), while the TNFα-induction of TNFAIP3 was reduced in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C). The suppression of IL6, ICAM1, and TNFAIP3 expression by COUP-TFII is in agreement with the data from the NFκB PCR array.
3.4. COUP-TFII selectively suppresses NFκB subunit gene and protein expressionRELB expression was decreased by COUP-TFII overexpression in the NFκB pathway PCR array. Increased NFκB subunit expression has been reported in several lineages of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells (Nehra et al., 2010; Riggins et al. 2005; Yde et al., 2012a,b), but possible correlation with COUP-TFII expression has not yet been examined. Consistent with these reports, we observed higher NFKB2, REL, and RELB expression in LCC9 vs. MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B). To compare the effect of COUP-TFII on basal and TNFα-induced increases in NFκB subunit expression, we set the parental vector (pcDNA) transfected relative expression of each gene to 1 in both MCF-7 and LCC9 cells (Fig. 3). TNFα increased the expression of NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, and RELB, but not RELA in both MCF-7 and LCC9 cells (Fig. 3A–E). COUP-TFII overexpression inhibited the basal expression of REL and RELA in LCC9 cells (Fig. 3C and E). The TNFα-induced increase in NFKB1, REL, and RELB expression was significantly reduced by COUP-TFII in LCC9 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A, C, and D).Next, we examined the effect of COUP-TFII on basal and TNFα-alterations in NFκB subunit protein expression. We set the parental vector (pcDNA) transfected relative expression of protein to 1 in MCF-7 to compare MCF-7 vs. LCC9 expression of the NFκB subunits (Fig. 4). LCC9 cells have higher basal expression of NFκB1 p105 and p50; NFκB2, RelB, and cRel compared to MCF-7 cells. RelA/p65 was lower in LCC9 than MCF-7 cells. Our data appear to differ from a report by Riggins et al. (2005) showing higher RelA/p65 and equal NFκB1 p50 protein levels in LCC9 and LCC1 cells, but we note that we are comparing LCC9 with MCF-7, not LCC1 cells. At the protein level, COUP-TFII overexpression decreased basal NFκB1 p105, NFκB2 p100, and RelB in MCF-7 cells and basal NFκB2 p100 in LCC9 cells (Fig. 4). COUP-TFII inhibited the TNFα-induced expression of NFκB2 p100, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel in MCF-7 cells and NFκB1 p105, RelA, and RelB in LCC9 cells (Fig. 4). Thus, COUP-TFII inhibits TNFα-induced increases in NFκB1 and RelB at both the mRNA and protein levels in LCC9 cells. Differences between protein and mRNA results for NFκB subunit expression may result from treatment conditions used for the experiment. Future plans include dissecting the time course of COUP-TFII’s effect on mRNA and protein expression.
3.5. COUP-TFII and NFκB expression are inversely correlated in breast cancer patient samplesTo examine the relationship between COUP-TFII and NFκB in breast cancer patients, publically available microarray gene expression data from 298 ERα+ patients treated with tamoxifen for 5 years was analyzed using the Spearman Rho (ρS) statistic determine if there was a correlation between COUP-TFII expression and the expression of NFκB subunits and target genes. COUP-TFII (NR2F2) expression was inversely correlated with NFκB subunit genes NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB and NFκB target genes ICAM1, IL6, and TNFAIP3 (Table 1).
3.6. COUP-TFII inhibits RelB, RelA, and p50 NFκB-DNA bindingTo examine the effect of COUP-TFII on specific NFκB subunit interaction with the NFκB RE, TransAM NFκB family assays were performed (Fig. 5). This assay quantitates specific protein-DNA binding in an ELISA format. The higher RelB-DNA binding activity detected in MCF-7 compared to LCC9 cells contrasts with the higher RELB mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein (Fig. 4) detected in LCC9 cells. The lack of increase in RelB-DNA binding in TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells in the ELISA was also surprising since we detected increased RELB mRNA in TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3D); although, TNFα did not increase total RelB protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4). The precise reason for this difference is unknown. It is possible that RELB, while higher in expression, might not be activated in LCC9 and thus, would not be expected to enter the nucleus. Basal RelA and cRel activation were not statistically different between the two cell lines, in agreement with mRNA and protein expression levels shown in Figs. 1B and 4. NFκB2 p52 activation was low in MCF-7 or LCC9 (data not shown), consistent with the lack of p52 protein expression seen in western blots (Fig. 4).In agreement with the higher level of NFκB1 p50 protein in LCC9 compared to MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4), NFκB1 p50 DNA binding activity was greater in NE from LCC9 than MCF-7 cells. While TNFα increased NFκB1 p50 activation in MCF-7 cells, no increase was detected in LCC9 cells. These data agree with the TNFα-induced increase in NFKB1 mRNA expression in MCF-7, but not the similar fold increase in NFKB1 mRNA in LCC9 cells (Fig. 3A). COUP-TFII had no effect on basal NFκB1 p50 DNA binding in MCF-7 cells, but inhibited basal NFκB1 p50 DNA binding in LCC9 cells. These data are opposite of the effect on NFκB1 p50 protein levels in MCF-7 where COUP-TFII reduced basal NFκB1 p50 protein, but had no effect on the amount of NFκB1 p50 in TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4). These data likely reflect differences in the type of cell extracts used in these assays, i.e., whole cell extracts in Fig. 4 would include active and inactive proteins vs. the NE in Fig. 5 which would contain only active proteins. While no further increase in NFκB1 p50 DNA binding was detected with TNFα treatment of LCC9 cells, COUP-TFII reduced the level of activated NFκB1 p50 DNA binding detected.RelB activation was significantly decreased by COUP-TFII-transfection in TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells. These data reflect the decrease in RelB protein with COUP-TFII transfection of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, there was no significant effect of COUP-TFII on TNFα-induced RELB mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3D). Activation of RelA was inhibited by COUP-TFII in both MCF-7 and LCC9 TNFα-treated cells as well as untreated LCC9 cells. COUP-TFII inhibited NFκB1/p50 more than RelA. The inhibition of RelA-DNA binding agrees with the decrease in RelA protein in COUP-TFII-transfected, TNFα treated MCF-7 and LCC9 cells (Fig. 4).Together, these data suggest that COUP-TFII has the most impact on inhibiting the DNA binding of NFκB subunit NFκB1 p50 to the NFκB RE in vitro and these results reflect the ability of COUP-TFII to reduce NFKB1 mRNA in LCC9 cells and NFκB1 p50 protein in both MCF-7 and LCC9 cells.
3.7. COUP-TFII interacts with NFκB subunitsAs COUP-TFII overexpression reduced NFκB1 p50 and RelB activation in TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5), and inhibited target gene expression (Fig. 2A–D), co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine if endogenous COUP-TFII interacts with NFκB subunits in NE from TNFα-treated MCF-7 cells. COUP-TFII basal expression is higher in MCF-7 than LCC9 cells progression (Riggs et al., 2006) (see also Supplemental Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of COUP-TFII revealed interaction between endogenous COUP-TFII and the NFκB subunit RelB and NFκB1 p50 in the NE (Fig. 6A). While interaction with RelB appears robust, we note that p50 is not detectable in the input NE, but a faint band is seen in the COUP-TFII-IP.
3.8. Inhibition of coactivator function by COUP-TFII reduces NFκB transcriptional activityCOUP-TFII was reported to inhibit the activity of androgen receptor (AR) by competing with transcriptional coactivators for AR interaction (Song et al., 2012). SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, and CBP function as NFκB coactivators (Gao et al., 2005). Each of these coactivators also have known interactions with COUP-TFII (Litchfield and Klinge, 2012). To determine if COUP-TFII represses NFκB signaling by interfering with coactivator function, LCC9 cells, with low endogenous COUP-TFII ((Riggs et al. 2006) and Supplemental Fig. 1) and high NFκB activity (Fig. 1A) were cotransfected with an NFκB luciferase reporter, with either pcDNA3.1 (empty vector negative control) or pcDNA3.1-COUP-TFII plasmids (as in Fig. 1A), and expression plasmids for SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, or CBP. The cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h to activate NFκB. TNFα increased Firefly luciferase activity ~10-fold (data not shown). The TNFα-induced luciferase reporter activity in the pcDNA-transfected cells was set to one to allow comparison of the relative effect of each transfected expression vector. SRC-1, SRC-3, and CBP increased NFκB activity in LCC9 cells compared to parental vector pcDNA (Fig. 6B). SRC-2 transfection had no effect on NFκB activity. Cotransfection with COUP-TFII decreased the TNFα-activated luciferase activity ~50%, similar to the data in Fig. 1A. COUP-TFII significantly inhibited the increase in NFκB activity by the coactivators SRC-1, SRC-3, and CBP (Fig. 6B), implicating COUP-TFII inhibition of coactivator function, e.g., competing with NFκB for coactivator interaction, as part of the mechanism of NFκB suppression.
3.9. Inhibition of p65/RelA phosphorylation by COUP-TFIIPhosphorylation of p65/RelA at Serine 529 is necessary for transcriptional activation (Wang and Baldwin, 1998; Zhao et al., 2008). To determine if COUP-TFII has an effect on p65/RelA phosphorylation, MCF-7 and LCC9 cells were transfected with COUP-TFII and treated with TNFα, and p65/RelA phosphorylation at Serine 529 was compared to total p65/RelA and β-actin (Fig. 7). Two p-RelA Ser 529 bands were detected and quantified relative to the β-actin loading control. Two p-RelA/p65 Ser 529 bands were seen previously (Kim et al., 2007; Yde et al., 2012a,b). COUP-TFII decreased both basal and TNFα-induced phosphorylation of p65/RelA in MCF-7 and TNFα-induced phosphorylation in LCC9 cells, suggesting this may be part of the mechanism of inhibition of NFκB activation by COUP-TFII.
3.10. Endocrine-resistant cells are sensitive to NFκB-inhibitionCell proliferation assays were performed to determine phenotypic effects of suppression of NFκB activity by COUP-TFII and to determine whether inhibition of NFκB by BMS-345541, an NFκB inhibitor that functions by inhibiting IκB kinase and subsequent downstream NFκB activation (Burke et al., 2003), would affect sensitivity of cells to 4-OHT. MCF-7 and LCC9 cells were treated with BMS-345541 in a range of concentrations (0.01–5 μμ) determined to be effective in inhibiting NFκB activity in serum-starved MCF-7 and LCC9 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4). MCF-7 were unaffected by BMS-345541 (Fig. 8A), commensurate with the low activity of NFκB in this cell line (see Fig. 1A). In contrast, the viability of LCC9 cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by BMS-345541 (Fig. 8B), reflecting LCC9’s increased reliance on a functional NFκB pathway for cell growth as endocrine-resistant cells (Nehra et al., 2010; Riggins et al., 2005).Reduced LCC9 cell viability was observed upon combined transfection with COUP-TFII and concomitant treatment with 4-OHT (Fig. 9A, white bars), reflecting COUP-TFII’s role in enhancing sensitivity of LCC9 to antiestrogens, as we previously reported (Riggs et al., 2006). LCC9 cells transfected with COUP-TFII and treated with a combination of 4-OHT, and BMS-345541 (Fig. 9A, white bars) exhibited a reduction in the higher range of BMS-345541 concentrations (Fig. 9A). Interestingly, when LCC9 cells were treated with TNFα, 4-OHT increased cell viability (Fig. 9B, dark grey bars). This effect was not observed in MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Fig. 5 or data not shown). This finding could have important translational implications if tamoxifen therapy causes similar effects in patients with high levels of inflammation and NFκB activation. This observed induction of LCC9 cell proliferation with TNFα and 4-OHT treatment was blocked by transfection with COUP-TFII (Fig. 9B, light grey bars) and/or treatment with higher concentrations of BMS-345541 (Fig. 9B, white bars).
4. Discussion
The NFκB pathway is constitutively activated in many types of cancer, including breast, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematological, and gynecological cancers, through a variety of mechanisms (Prasad et al., 2010). NFκB target genes have roles in oncogenic transformation, including apoptosis resistance (Opipari et al., 1992; Vendrell et al., 2007), invasion (Soria and Ben-Baruch, 2008), and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (Huber et al., 2004). Here we demonstrate that COUP-TFII inhibits TNFα-induced NFκB activity in LCC9 endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Consistent with previous reports that the NFκB pathway is activated during progression to breast cancer endocrine-resistance (Nakshatri et al., 1997; Nehra et al., 2010; Pratt et al., 2003; Riggins et al., 2005; Sovak et al., 1997; Yde et al., 2012a,b), LCC9 cells exhibited higher basal and TNFα-induced NFκB activity than MCF-7 parental, endocrine-sensitive breast cancer cells. This is the first demonstration that COUP-TFII inhibits NFκB activity. This inhibition led to downregulation of TNFα-induced NFκB target gene expression of IL6, ICAM1, and TNFAIP3, which had reduced basal and/or TNFα-induced expression upon COUP-TFII overexpression. The inflammatory cytokine IL6 is a negative prognostic indicator for breast cancer patients (Knupfer and Preiss, 2007), and may have a role in trastuzumab resistance (Korkaya et al., 2012). Downregulation of the glycoprotein adhesion molecule ICAM1 at the mRNA and protein levels was reported to suppress human breast cell invasion (Rosette et al., 2005). The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20/TNFAIP3 protects MCF-7 cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis, and cells overexpressing TNFAIP3 are resistant to tamoxifen (Krikos et al., 1992; Opipari et al., 1992; Vendrell et al., 2007). Thus, we suggest the ability of COUP-TFII to inhibit NFκB-stimulated TNFAIP3 may play a role in the observed ability of COUP-TFII to resensitize LCC9 cells to 4-OHT.
NFκB subunit expression is regulated by the NFκB pathway in a positive feedback loop. Specifically, RelA activates expression of RelB (Bren et al., 2001) and NFκB2 (Lombardi et al., 1995), while NFκB1/p50 expression is regulated by a combination of p50 and RelA (Ten et al., 1992). Similarly, c-Rel is also capable of autoregulation (Hannink and Temin, 1990). Because COUP-TFII suppresses genes that are targets of the NFκB pathway, this would also be expected to lead to reduced expression of the NFκB subunits as observed. Consistent with our data showing higher NFκB subunit and target gene expression in LCC9 endocrine-resistant cells, NFκB subunits NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, and REL as well as the NFκB gene targets ICAM1 and TNFAIP3 are also upregulated in inflammatory breast cancer patient samples (Lerebours et al., 2008). These data also suggest that COUP-TFII inhibits both the classical and alternative (canonical and noncanonical) NFκB pathways. A previous study showed that overexpression of COUP-TFII inhibited 15Δ-PGJ2-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and promoter activity in U937 human myeloid cells, a result which the authors attributed to COUP-TFII competing with PPARγ to form a heterodimer with RXR or by forming a COUP-TFII/RXR heterodimer and competing with PPARγ/RXR for DNA binding (Zhang et al., 2001).
COUP-TFII was recently identified as one of four NRs that are significant predictors of metastasis-free survival in tamoxifen-treated breast cancers, independent of ERα expression (Muscat et al., 2013). We previously observed that COUP-TFII expression was reduced with histological grade (Litchfield et al., 2012) and this was confirmed by other investigators in (Muscat et al., 2013). Here we report for the first time that COUP-TFII, i.e., NR2F2 gene expression was inversely correlated with NFκB subunit genes NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB and NFκB target genes ICAM1, IL6, and TNFAIP3 in microarray data from 298 ERα+ breast tumors from patients treated with TAM for 5 years (Table 1).
Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that COUP-TFII interacts with NFκB subunit RelB and NFκB1 p50 and inhibits NFκB-DNA-binding. COUP-TFII also inhibited the ability of coactivators SRC-1, SRC-3, and CBP to enhance NFκB transactivation and TNFα-induced phosphorylation of RelA on Ser 529, required for p300 coactivator recruitment and RelA transactivation function (Chew et al., 2009). The effects of COUP-TFII on NFκB lead to inhibition of cell proliferation, with endocrine-resistant LCC9 cell proliferation effectively reduced when treated with an NFκB inhibitor. Overall, these data suggest that the general downregulation of NFκB target gene expression by COUP-TFII may play a role in endocrine sensitivity. As NFκB is activated in endocrine-resistant cells, blockade of downstream NFκB target gene expression by COUP-TFII offers a possible mechanism by which COUP-TFII enables breast cancer cells to maintain endocrine sensitivity. Natural product inhibitors of NFκB activity such as parthenolide (Riggins et al., 2005), curcumin (Jobin et al., 1999; Singh and Aggarwal, 1995), and ellagic acid (Edderkaoui et al., 2008), as well as synthetic inhibitors (Burke et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2005a,b), provide compounds for future experimental and possible translational purposes. The surprising observation that the combination of 4-OHT with lower concentrations of the NFκB inhibitor BMS-345541 stimulated the proliferation of LCC9 cells treated with TNFα (but not MCF-7 cells, data not shown) offers a cautionary note that requires further in vivo study. Overall, these data point to the potential for evaluating COUP-TFII as a marker for breast tumors that may be sensitive to the combination of NFκB inhibitors with antiestrogen therapies, e.g. tamoxifen, to promote endocrine sensitivity and prevent disease progression.
