Introduction
To alleviate the current high dependency on fossil fuels, the utilization of renewable biomass for producing fuels and chemicals is considered important. Third-generation biomass, represented by marine algae, has emerged as the valorization resource for producing bio-based fuels and chemicals1–3. This is because of many advantages of third-generation biomass over lignocellulose from plants. They contain little or no lignin; require no arable land, water, and fertilizers1; and fix CO2 at a high rate1,2,4. Macroalgal carbohydrates are the main resource for biological or chemical valorization of macroalgal biomass1–3,5–7. Macroalgal carbohydrates could be readily usable owing to the absence of lignin, but their main components are unique carbohydrate monomers that are rare in terrestrial organisms1–3,5–8. For example, brown and red macroalgae contain alginate and agarose as the main carbohydrates, respectively1,2.
Red macroalgae are widely distributed throughout the world and exhibit the largest production among marine algae9. The production of red macroalgae steadily increased annually, achieving the annual production of ~1.8 × 1010 kg in 20159. In addition, red macroalgae have the higher carbohydrate contents and simpler carbohydrate compositions than other marine algae1,2. Therefore, red macroalgae are regarded as feasible feedstocks for producing fuels and chemicals. However, while the biological conversion of uronic acid, the monomer of alginate, was extensively studied and developed to efficiently valorize brown macroalgae3,5,6, fewer efforts have been made to convert 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose (AHG), the most abundant monomeric sugar of agarose along with D-galactose8 despite the high usability of red macroalgae owing to their high carbohydrate contents (up to 80% of the total dry weight) and simple carbohydrate compositions1,2. AHG is not metabolized by any terrestrial microbes, but it can be metabolized by some marine microbes2. Recently, we revealed the novel AHG metabolic pathway in the marine microbe Vibrio sp. EJY38. However, efficient and high utilization of AHG via fermentation is not currently possible because of the acid- and heat-labile properties of AHG8,10. In fact, AHG was found to be easily degraded at a temperature higher than 50 °C (Fig. S1a). It is impossible to valorize AHG as the main sugar of red macroalgae for fuel and chemical production without resolving the instability problem of AHG.
Sugar alcohols are used as platform chemicals11–13. For example, sorbitol, an alcohol form of glucose that is produced by hydrogenating glucose, is one of the most important platform chemicals because it can be converted to various valuable chemicals12,13. Especially, sorbitan, which is anhydrosorbitol, an anhydrohexitol produced by dehydrating sorbitol, is regarded as a key platform chemical for producing fatty acid esters that are used as surfactants, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and biologically active substances12,14,15. In addition, sorbitan can be converted to isosorbide, 1,4:3,6-dianhydrohexitol, by dehydration. Isosorbide is an intermediate chemical for producing various plastics and medicines12,13,16,17.
The dehydration step to produce anhydrohexitols from sugar alcohols is a high energy-consuming process requiring high temperature and pressure12,14. However, since AHG is already the dehydrated form of galactose, AHGol, the anhydrohexitol form of AHG, can be produced just by reducing the aldehyde group of AHG without dehydration, resulting in an energy-efficient process. The chemical stability of AHG and its route as a new platform chemical could be acquired by converting AHG to AHGol. To efficiently produce AHGol from agarose of red macroalgae, it should first be easy to produce AHG from agarose. Although there have been many studies of AHG production by and/or enzymatically hydrolyzing agarose, these processes are complex and costly, and they require multiple enzymatic steps18–20. We recently developed a simple and efficient agarose saccharification process for producing AHG21. This process directly hydrolyzes agarose to AB, a disaccharide of galactose and AHG bonded by a β−1,4-glycosidic linkage, by preferentially cleaving α−1,3-glycosidic linkages of agarose using phosphoric acid as a catalyst, and then AB can be hydrolyzed into AHG and galactose using a single enzyme21.
To date, sugar alcohols and anhydrohexitols have been mainly produced by chemical reduction12,16. Reduction of aldehyde moieties by biocatalysis is eco-friendly and sustainable due to no use of toxic chemicals22,23. Furthermore, enzymes catalyze unique regio- and stereo-specific reductive reactions of aldehyde moieties, resulting in fewer side reactions than chemical reduction22,23. Here, biological reduction with aldose reductase (AR) may be used to efficiently convert AHG to AHGol as an alternative to chemical reduction. To efficiently produce AHGol from agarose, we devised an integrated chemical and biological process consisting of i) a chemical process that depolymerizes agarose to AB using phosphoric acid and ii) a biological process using a metabolically engineered yeast in which AB is hydrolyzed into galactose and AHG and then AHG is further converted to AHGol (Scheme 1). To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a new conversion route has been devised for upgrading AHG to a new platform chemical, AHGol.
Results and discussion
In vitro enzymatic conversion of AHG to AHGol and AB to agarobitolTo valorize AHG, it is necessary to resolve the heat- and acid-labile problems of AHG10 and to convert the rare sugar, AHG, to a platform chemical. The chemical instability of AHG may be due to the high reactivity of the aldehyde group at the C1 position10. Here, we biologically convert AHG in agarose from red macroalgae to AHGol by reducing the aldehyde group to an alcohol group (Fig. 1). Since there has been no study on the bioconversion of AHG to its alcohol, AHGol, we attempted to enzymatically convert AHG to AHGol in vitro (Fig. 1). Since AHG is aldose and GRE3 from S. cerevisiae, which codes for AR, is known to have broad substrate specificity against various aldoses24, AHG was incubated with purified recombinant AR that was overexpressed at 37 kDa by Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Fig. 1a). AR successfully converted AHG to AHGol (Fig. 1b,c). Although the specific activity of AR for AHG was 1.4 times lower than the activity with xylose, it was 2.0 times higher than the activity with galactose (Fig. 1b). AR showed enzymatic activity for AB by converting AB to its alcohol form, agarobitol (ABol). However, it was lower than other substrates (Fig. 1b).Since the authentic standards of AHGol and ABol are not commercially available, we identified AHGol and ABol using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Fig. 1 and ESI). First, we compared the total ion chromatograms of GC/MS analysis before and after enzymatic reactions. The peak abundances of AHG and AB decreased, and the new putative AHGol and ABol peaks appeared after the enzymatic reactions (Figs. 1c and S2a). Further, the spectrum patterns showed differences between AHG and AHGol and between AB and ABol (Figs. 2c and S2a). In addition, there were two protons at 6-position in the one-dimensional (1D) 1H-NMR spectrum of AHGol, and the CH2 group was at 6-position in the two-dimensional (2D) 1H-13C edited HSQC NMR spectrum of AHGol (Fig. 1d,e). These results indicate that the aldehyde group at the 6-position was converted an alcohol group. The results of ABol NMR analysis were similar to AHGol NMR analysis (Fig. S2b,c). Additional NMR results of AHGol and ABol are provided in Figs. S3 and S4 and Tables S2 and S3.
Thermal stability comparison of AHG and AHGolAHGol produced and purified in this study was tested for its thermal stability at various temperatures ranging from 4 to 70 °C for 15 weeks. AHGol was stable at the tested temperatures (Fig. S1b) unlike AHG (Fig. S1a). For example, AHG started degrading even at 50 °C and completely degraded to other compounds including 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) within 5 weeks at 70 °C (Fig. S1a). However, AHGol was stable for 15 weeks even at 70 °C (Fig. S1b). These results are due to the conversion of the aldehyde group of AHG to an alcohol group. Therefore, the conversion of AHG to AHGol is useful as upgrading of thermally-unstable AHG.
Construction of AB-utilizing S. cerevisiaeTo more efficiently and economically produce AHGol from agarose, the in vitro enzymatic reactions performed earlier in this study was switched to the in vivo production system by using the engineered S. cerevisiae as a host due to the high total costs of enzymes and cofactors used for the enzymatic reactions. However, owing to the chemical instability of AHG as experimentally confirmed in this study (Fig. S1), it was observed that degradation of AHG occurred in culture medium during fermentation in our previous study8. To avoid AHG degradation during fermentation, AB produced from the hydrolysis of agarose was used as the substrate to produce AHGol instead of using AHG as the substrate in this study. Since AB can be produced directly from agarose using single-step acid hydrolysis of agarose with phosphoric acid21 (Scheme 1), it is more convenient to produce AHGol using AB than AHG. For S. cerevisiae to utilize AB, AB must be transported into the cell and hydrolyzed into AHG and galactose. Since S. cerevisiae does not have a lactose catabolic pathway25, S. cerevisiae was presumed to be unable to transport and hydrolyze AB because both AB and lactose are disaccharides with β−1,4-glycosidic linkages and are structurally similar. Therefore, the catabolic system of Kluyveromyces lactis was introduced into S. cerevisiae.First, the LAC12 gene encoding lactose permease of K. lactis was introduced into the genome of the parental strain S. cerevisiae D452–2 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to construct a transport system for AB (Table S1)26. AB was added to verify AB uptake by lactose permease in the engineered S. cerevisiae strain D452–12. Expectedly, strain D452-L12 expressing lactose permease successfully took up AB and produce ABol unlike strain D452–2, in which ABol production was due to AB conversion to ABol by intracellular AR encoded by endogenous GRE3 in S. cerevisiae (Figs. 2a and S5a,b).Second, AB should be hydrolyzed into AHG and galactose once AB is transported inside the cell by lactose permease. The AB-utilizing strain D452-L124 was constructed by integrating the LAC4 gene encoding the K. lactis β-galactosidase into the strain D452-L12 genome using the CRISPR-Cas9 system because of the inability of S. cerevisiae to hydrolyze lactose and presumably AB (Table S1)25. The cell-free lysate of strain D452-L124 was used for the enzymatic reaction to verify AB hydrolysis by β-galactosidase encoded by LAC4. It was found to hydrolyze both AB and lactose unlike strains D452-L12 and D452–2 (Fig. 2c).Finally, the intracellular AHG hydrolyzed from AB should be converted to AHGol by AR encoded by endogenous GRE3 of strain D452-L124. GRE3 in engineered S. cerevisiae, D452-L12 and D452-L124, was expressed well by AB, resulting in the production of ABol from AB (Figs. 2a and S5a,b). Unlike in the presence of glucose, the endogenous gene GRE3 was highly expressed in the presence of AB in strain D452-L124 (Fig. S6).Taken together, the final strain D452-L124 was engineered to take up AB, intracellularly hydrolyze AB to AHG and galactose, and convert AHG to AHGol. Consequently, we used AB directly as a substrate instead of AHG for biologically upgrading AHG to AHGol because of several advantages obtained when using the engineered S. cerevisiae host. The first advantage is that exposure to unstable AHG culture medium can be minimized by directly transporting AB into cells and intracellularly hydrolyzing AB into galactose and AHG. The second advantage is that the separate enzymatic step for hydrolyzing AB using intracellular AB hydrolysis can be replaced. In addition, since S. cerevisiae has an intracellular aldose reductase which is encoded by GRE3, AHG can be spontaneously converted to AHGol well without extra gene manipulation24. The last advantage is that galactose from AB can be used as a carbon source for the host microbe and for the cofactor regeneration for the enzymatic reaction with AHG.
AB toxicity in S. cerevisiaeWe used engineered S. cerevisiae to biologically upgrade AHG to AHGol. S. cerevisiae is robust even in the presence of various stresses in industrial cultivation environments27, 28. However, AHG is known to have inhibitory activity against microbes like Streptococcus mutans29,30. Similarly, AB also showed inhibitory activity against S. mutans, which was probably due to the activity of AHG located at the reducing end of AB31. Since AB was determined to be used as a substrate for AHGol production in this study, it was necessary to evaluate the possible toxicity of AB toward S. cerevisiae strains used or constructed in this study. Here, AB toxicity was tested in strains D452-L124, D452-L12, and D452–2 at AB concentrations of 0, 10, 20, and 50 g/L in Verduyn medium with 20 g/L glucose as the carbon source. The engineered strains D452-L12 and D452-L124, which expressed lactose permease, were more inhibited by AB than the parent strain D452–2 (Fig. 3). The specific growth rates of strains D452-L124 and D452-L12 decreased with increased AB concentration, and there was no growth in the presence of 50 g/L of AB (Fig. 3a). At 0, 10, and 20 g/L AB, the cell concentrations obtained from strain D452-L124 were 1.85, 1.43, and 1.08 g/L at 24 h, respectively (Fig. 3a). However, the specific growth rate of the parental strain D452–2 did not decrease after increasing the AB concentration to 20 g/L. The specific growth rate significantly decreased at 50 g/L AB. The decreasing trends of the specific glucose consumption rates of the three strains followed those of their specific growth rates (Fig. 3b). The higher AB toxicity in strains D452-L124 and D452-L12 compared to strain D452–2 may be due to increased AB transport into cells of strains D452-L124 and D452-L12, which both express lactose permease.
Hydrolysis of agarose to ABTo prepare agarose hydrolysate containing mainly AB, which is the substrate for AHGol production, agarose was first depolymerized into AB at 95°C for 120 min using 2% (w/v) H3PO421. H3PO4 of the agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 using Ca(OH)2 (Fig. S7). Neutralized agarose hydrolysate containing 129 g/L AB was obtained and used as the substrate for further fermentation experiments to produce AHGol from AB.
Effect of the initial AB loading on AHGol productionTo obtain a high AHGol titer, it is necessary to have a high initial AB loading in culture medium. Therefore, the initial cell concentration of strain D452-L124 was increased from 2 g/L (Fig. 2a,b) to 6 g/L for batch fermentation due to the AB toxicity against S. cerevisiae cell growth that we noted earlier (Fig. S8). The effect of the initial AB loading was investigated at 10, 20, 45, and 90 g/L of AB when 6 g/L cells were inoculated for the batch AB fermentation. Cell growth, AB consumption, and AHGol production occurred well when the AB loadings were 10, 20, and 45 g/L (Fig. S8a,b,c). For example, the final AHGol titer increased from 4.62 to 18.62 g/L as AB concentrations increased from 10 to 45 g/L (Table 1). However, when AB was increased to 90 g/L, cell growth, AB consumption, and AHGol production were lower than those at 45 g/L AB (Fig. S8c,d). For example, the final AB titer, 12.91 g/L, at 90 g/L AB was lower than the final titer of 18.62 g/L at 45 g/L AB (Table 1).In the case of AHGol yields, similar levels like 0.47 and 0.48 g AHGol/g AB were maintained at 10 and 20 g/L of AB, respectively (Table 1). However, the AHGol yields decreased to 0.42 and 0.20 g/g, respectively, when AB was increased to 45 and 90 g/L (Table 1). There may be several reasons for the lower AHGol yields with increased AB concentrations. First, it could be due to the transglycosylation activity of β-galactosidase encoded by LAC4 introduced into S. cerevisiae. β-Galactosidase encoded by LAC4 from K. lactis belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 2, and it is known to have transglycosylation activity32, 33. Transglycosylation activity in the GH family generally occurs at a high mass ratio of substrate to enzyme34, 35. Culture broth samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to investigate the possibility of β-galactosidase transglycosylation activity in D452-L124 against AB. Oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) over 3 were gradually produced as the AB concentration increased (Fig. S9). In particular, the AHGol yield was the lowest at the highest AB concentration, 90 g/L, and oligosaccharides with DP of 3 and over 4 were more abundantly produced (Fig. S9d) than at other lower initial AB loadings (Fig. S9a,b,c). Second, the lower AHGol yield at higher AB concentrations may also be attributed to the fact that ABol was more abundantly produced as AB loading was increased (Table 1) due to AR activity against AB.Taken together, 20 g/L of AB was selected as the optimal initial loading for batch fermentation with strain D452-L124 among the tested AB loadings to avoid poor AB utilization and inefficient conversion to AHGol at high AB loading.
Fed-batch fermentation of AB for AHGol productionTo obtain the high final titer of AHGol by overcoming the growth inhibition by AB, in addition to increasing the initial cell concentration to 6 g/L and loading AB at 20 g/L for batch fermentation, the fed-batch fermentation was performed in a bioreactor. First, to promote consumption of galactose released by AB hydrolysis before the main fermentation, cells of strain D452-L124 were pre-cultivated on galactose as a carbon source. Next, galactose was intermittently fed until the cell density increased to ~20 g/L during the growth phase before loading agarose hydrolysate containing mainly AB. For instance, the cell density increased from 5.51 to 23.85 g/L (Fig. 4). Next, during the fermentation phase, agarose hydrolysate was intermittently fed to the bioreactor five times whenever the AB concentration decreased below 5 g/L. In the fed-batch fermentation in the bioreactor, approximately 20 g/L AB was consumed within 10 h for each agarose hydrolysate feeding cycle (Fig. 4). However, 20 g/L AB was consumed in 48 h in the batch fermentation in flasks (Fig. S8). The much higher rate of AB consumption was probably due to the relatively higher ratio of cell concentration to AB owing to the fed-batch mode and better cultivation conditions in the bioreactor, including the stronger agitation and aeration, than in the flasks. From the fed-batch fermentation, we obtained a high titer and yield of AHGol of 41.18 g/L and 0.47 g AHGol /g AB, respectively (Fig. 4).Meanwhile, fermentation byproducts like ethanol, glycerol, and acetic acid that were produced by galactose feeding for cell growth were almost completely consumed during the fermentation phase (Fig. 4). Since AB was efficiently hydrolyzed into AHG and galactose and galactose was then efficiently consumed, small amounts of ABol and galactitol—0.68 g/L and 1.18 g/L, respectively—were produced (Fig. 4). Therefore, fed-batch fermentation of agarose hydrolysate resulted in a high AHGol yield with high AB loading. The low fermentation byproduct production enabled simple AHGol purification step using size exclusion chromatography with distilled water as a mobile phase (Fig. S10).
Chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbideSince AHGol is stable unlike AHG and has a unique structure, AHGol could be used as a platform chemical for producing a variety of chemicals such as fatty acid esters and dianhydrohexitols by biological and chemical reactions; this is analogous to the utilization of sugars from lignocellulose (Fig. 5)12,14. To experimentally test the feasibility of AHGol as a platform chemical, we investigated the chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbide that is one of the most important intermediate chemicals and precursors for bio-based chemical production (Fig. 6). By slightly modifying a previously reported method36, we successfully converted AHGol to isosorbide using 1% (w/v) H2SO4 at 105 °C. The peak intensity of the unique daughter ion of AHGol at 362 m/z in the extracted ion chromatogram of GC/MS analysis decreased after the chemical conversion (Fig. 6b), and the peak of the product newly appeared at 275 m/z, which was detected at the same retention time of an authentic isosorbide standard (Fig. 6c). It was also confirmed that the mass spectrum of isosorbide acquired by the GC/MS analysis in the reaction product (Fig. 6d) was identical with the spectrum obtained from its authentic standard (Fig. 6e).To date, lignocellulose has been considered to be the feedstock of the biorefinery. Sorbitol was converted to isosorbide in a lignocellulose-based biorefinery (Fig. 5)14,36–38. Here, AHGol produced from red macroalgae was converted to isosorbide using H2SO4 as the catalyst (Fig. 6). Although the conversion yield of AHGol to isosorbide was low (e.g., 7.2%, data not shown) without process optimization, this is the first study in which the rare sugar from red macroalgae, AHG, can be used to produce platform chemicals such as AHGol. Furthermore, it may be possible to increase the conversion yield by selecting a suitable catalyst and optimizing the conversion process.
Experimental
Strains and plasmidsAB-consuming yeast strain D452-L124 was constructed as follows. LAC12 encoding lactose permease26 (NCBI Gene ID: 2897085) was cloned into the pRS423-pGPD plasmid. The LAC12 gene fragment was amplified from K. lactis NRRL Y-8279 genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer pairs LAC12-F and LAC12-R (Table S1). The PCR product and plasmid pRS423-pGPD were digested using SpeI and SalI and ligated to construct plasmid pRS423-pGPD-LAC12 (Table S1). The LAC4 gene encoding β-galactosidase (NCBI Gene ID: 2897170) was also generated using PCR with K. lactis NRRL Y-8279 genomic DNA as a template. The LAC4 gene, which was amplified by primers LAC4-F and LAC4-R (Table S1), and pRS425-pGPD plasmid were digested using SpeI and SalI and ligated to construct plasmid pRS425GPD-LAC4 (Table S1).Guide plasmids p42K-CS8 and p42K-CS6 were constructed to integrate the target genes into the strain D452–2 genome for stable expression (Table S1 and ESI for details). The plasmids were constructed using reverse PCR of the pRS42K plasmid containing the guide RNA sequence with primer pairs gCS8-U/gCS8-D and gCS6-U/gCS6-D, respectively (Table S1), to construct plasmids p42K-CS8 and p42K-CS6. The 20 bp targeting sequence of guide RNA binds to the empty locus of chromosomes XVI (CS8) and VII (CS6). The target genes will be integrated into these loci without affecting the function of other genes via homologous recombination.To integrate LAC12 into the genome of strain D452–2, plasmid pRS423-pGPD-LAC12 was amplified using primer pair CS8-IU/CS8-ID as donor DNAs for CRISPR-Cas9-based integration as previously described39. The transformants with CS8-LAC12 integration were confirmed using PCR with primers CS8-CKU/CS8-CKD, and the transformant was designated as strain D452-L12. Similarly, CS6-LAC4 was integrated into strain D452-L12 with donor DNA amplified from plasmid pRS425-pGPD-LAC4 using primer CS6-IU/CS6-ID. The transformants were confirmed using PCR with primers CS6-CKU/CS6-CKD. The engineered strain with CS8-LAC12 and CS6-LAC4 integration was named D452-L124.To construct plasmid pET21α-GRE3, the GRE3 gene (NCBI GenBank: 856504) encoding AR was amplified using PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA with primer pairs GRE3-F and GRE3-R (Table S1). A poly-6-histidine residue was added to the C terminus of the protein to purify the protein using affinity chromatography. The amplified product and pET21α vector were digested using NdeI and NotI, and they were ligated to construct the pET21α-GRE3 plasmid. The constructed plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3).
Medium and culture conditionsYeast strains were routinely cultivated in Verduyn medium40 and 50 mM potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) buffer (pH 5.5) at 30 °C with agitation at 300 rpm. Verduyn medium contains the following components/L: 10 g KH2PO4, 2.5 g MgSO4, 10 mL concentrated trace element solution, and 15 mL vitamin solution. The concentrated trace element solution contains the following components/L: 15 g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; 5.75 g ZnSO4; 0.32 g MnCl2; 0.5 g CuSO4; 0.47 g CoCl2; 0.48 g Na2MoO4; 2.9 g CaCl2; and 2.8 g FeSO4. The vitamin solution contains the following components/L: 0.05 g biotin; 1 g calcium pantothenate; 1 g nicotinic acid; 25 g myoinositol; 1 g thiamine hydrochloride; 1 g pyridoxol hydrochloride; and 0.2 g p-aminobenzoic acid. All Verduyn medium components except for vitamin solution were autoclaved at 120 °C for 15 min before use. The vitamin solution was filter sterilized using a 0.2 μm membrane (Whatman, Germany) before use. For seed cultures, each strain was grown in YP medium containing 20 g/L glucose (YPD) or galactose as a carbon source at the exponential phase.
AR enzyme assayTo assay AR enzyme activity, E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pET21α-GRE3 was cultivated in LB medium containing 50 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C and 200 rpm until the culture broth optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.5. Overexpression of the enzyme was induced using 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 16 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested using centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the recombinant enzyme. The cell pellet was re-suspended into a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, disrupted by ultrasonication, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The enzyme was purified using a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The purified enzyme was analyzed using 8% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. AR activity was determined by measuring the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ coupled with reduction of AHG to AHGol at 340 nm. The reaction mixture containing 2 mM substrates such as AHG, AB, galactose, or xylose, and 1 mM NADPH, and 0.35 mg/mL recombinant enzyme in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 30 °C. The decrease in optical density at 340 nm was measured using a Synergy HT plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Enzymatic assays were performed in triplicate.
Measurement of AB uptake due to LAC12 introductionThe ability of the cell to take up AB via genomic integration of LAC12 in S. cerevisiae was examined using the parental S. cerevisiae strain D452–2 and the engineered strain D452-L12. Pre-culture of yeast strains was performed in YPD medium at the exponential phase and harvested by centrifugation at 1,560 × g for 10 min before transferring into the Verduyn medium and 50 mM KHP buffer containing 1.8 g/L AB with or without the 10 g/L carbon sources like glucose or galactose. The initial cell density was adjusted to OD600 = 4. The uptake ability of AB into the cell was determined by measuring and comparing AB and ABol concentrations using HPLC. The AB uptake experiments were performed in duplicate.
AB hydrolysis enzymatic assay by LAC4Cell-free lysates of the parental strain D452–2 and the engineered strains D452-L12 and D452-L124 were prepared. Each strain was grown in YPD medium at the exponential phase and harvested by centrifuging at 1,560 × g for 10 min. The cell-free lysates regarded as the crude enzymes were prepared using our cell disruption method and used for the AB hydrolysis enzyme assay. Protein concentrations in cell-free lysates were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a protein standard. Each cell extract (0.5 mg of protein each) was incubated with 2 g of AB in 1 mL of 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at 30 °C for 7 h. Lactose was used as a positive control. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and the AB hydrolysis reaction products were measured using HPLC. Enzyme assays were performed in duplicate.
AB toxicity testThe toxicities of AB against the parental strain D452–2 and the engineered strains D452-L12 and D452-L124 in Verduyn medium and 50 mM KHP buffer were evaluated. For seed cultures, each strain was inoculated into YPD medium. Each seed culture was transferred into Verduyn medium containing 20 g/L glucose with different concentrations of AB ranging from 10 to 50 g/L. The initial cell density after inoculation was adjusted to OD600 = 0.2. The specific growth and glucose consumption rates were compared. These experiments were performed in duplicate.
Preparation of agarose hydrolysate containing mostly ABTo prepare agarose hydrolysate, which mainly contains AB as the substrate for AHGol production, we slightly modified our previous method related to AB production21. First, 90 g of agarose (Genomic Base, Seoul, Korea) was added into 360 mL of 2% (w/v) H3PO4. The agarose mixture was hydrolyzed into AB at 95 °C for 120 min in a water bath. After acid hydrolysis, agarose hydrolysate was neutralized to pH 6.0 while H3PO4 from agarose hydrolysate was removed using Ca(OH)2. The agarose hydrolysate was used as the substrate for further fermentation experiments.
FermentationBatch fermentation for AHGol production was performed using engineered strain D452-L124 at various AB concentrations at 30 °C and 300 rpm in 125 mL flasks. Pre-cultured cells in YPD medium were centrifuged at 1,560 × g for 10 min and washed twice using sterilized distilled water. The harvested cells were inoculated into 20 mL of Verduyn medium and 50 mM KHP buffer containing from 10 to 90 g/L AB. The initial cell densities were adjusted to approximately OD600 = 13. Fermentation experiments were performed in duplicate.Fed-batch fermentation was performed in a 1 L bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific-Eppendorf, Enfield, CT) containing 450 mL of Verduyn medium. YP medium containing 20 g/L galactose as a carbon source was used for the seed culture. Strain D452-L124 was grown in 5 mL of the first seed medium before transferring into a 1 L flask containing 250 mL of the second seed medium. The 250 mL seed culture was harvested and washed using the same method as described above before being inoculated into the bioreactor. The initial galactose concentration, which was used as the carbon source, was 25 g/L, and additional galactose was added to the bioreactor to 25 g/L after its depletion. The addition of galactose was stopped when the OD600 reached 60, and agarose hydrolysate was added to the bioreactor. Additional agarose hydrolysate was fed into the bioreactor when the AB concentration was approximately below 5 g/L. Cells were cultured at an agitation speed of 500 to 1,000 rpm, air flow rate of 1 v/v/m, and pH 5.8. The culture pH was automatically controlled by adding 5 N NaOH.
AHGol separation and purificationAHGol from the enzymatic reaction product or fermentation culture was separated and purified using size exclusion chromatography. A fast protein liquid chromatography system (AKTA Prime, GE Healthcare) with Sephadex G-10 resin was used with distilled water as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Purified AHGol was used for further experiments to test the thermal stability, conversion to isosorbide, and NMR analysis.
AHG and AHGol thermal stability testsIn-house purified AHG and AHGol were incubated for 15 weeks at various temperatures ranging from 4 to 70°C. Samples were periodically withdrawn to monitor the degree of thermal degradation of AHGol and AHG using HPLC. These experiments were performed in duplicate.
Chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbideIn-house purified AHGol was converted to isosorbide using H2SO4 according to a previous method with slight modifications36. The chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbide was performed by incubating 10 g/L AHGol in 1% (w/w) H2SO4 at 105 °C for 42 h in a drying oven. During the reaction, water evaporation was counteracted by adding back the same amount of water every 8 h. The conversion of AHGol to isosorbide was confirmed using HPLC and GC/MS to compare with an isosorbide standard.
Cell growth measurementThe OD600 was monitored by using UV-visible Spectrophotometer to monitor cell growth (Biomate 5, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The cell dry weight was determined from the calibration of OD600 compared to dry cell weight.
HPLC analysisSugars such as glucose, galactose, and AB, sugar alcohols such as AHGol, ABol, and galactitol, fermentation byproducts such as ethanol, glycerol, and acetic acid, and isosorbide were analyzed using HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1200 Series) equipped with a refractive index detector and a Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H+ (8%) column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) with 0.005 N H2SO4 as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 65 °C. To measure the transglycosylation activity of strain D452-L124, samples were analyzed with a gel permeation column (KS-802; Shodex, Tokyo, Japan) using distilled water as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at 80 °C.
GC/MS analysisTo investigate the conversion of AHG and AB to AHGol and ABol, respectively, by in vitro AR enzyme reactions and by fermentation and the chemical conversion of AHGol to isosorbide, GC/MS analysis were performed. For the GC/MS analysis, 20 μL of enzymatic reaction products or fermentation cultures were dried using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator. Samples were derivatized by adding 10 μL of 40 mg/mL methoxyamine chloride in pyridine and incubating at 30 °C for 90 min. The samples were trimethylsilylated by adding 45 μL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The chemically derivatized samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A GC/5975C MSD system (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) equipped with a 30 m HP-5MS column with a 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness, and a 10 m guard column. The 1 μL derivatized sample was injected into the GC column in splitless mode. The oven temperature of the GC was programmed to initially be at 80 °C for 1 min before ramping to 300 °C at 10 °C/min for 1 min. Electron ionization was performed at 70 eV. The temperatures of the ion source and transfer line were 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were recorded in a scan range of 20–700 m/z.
NMR analysisSamples were dissolved in D2O for NMR analysis. All experiments were performed and recorded on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer operating at 900 MHz and at 298 K (Bruker, Billerica, MA). The instrument was equipped with a CP TXI cryoprobe and controlled using Topspin software (version 3.2; Bruker). Chemical shifts were referenced to deuterated TSP (3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid). Data were processed using Topspin software by zero-filling once in each dimension, followed by apodization, Fourier transformation, and phasing. Spectra were analyzed using Mnova software (Mestrelab Research, Escondido, CA).A 1D 1H NMR spectrum of AHGol was acquired with pulse sequence noesypr1d using a mixing time of 150 ms. A total of 64 k complex points were acquired using a spectral width of 11.1 ppm, a carrier frequency of 4.7 ppm, and a recycle delay of 2 s.An edited 1H-13C HSQC experiment of AHGol, in which carbons with one or three attached protons are opposite in phase to those with two protons, was recorded using Bruker pulse sequence hsqcedetgpsisp2.241. A total of 2048 and 128 complex points were recorded in the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively. The spectral widths were set to 11.1 ppm for 1H and 130 ppm for 13C using carrier frequencies of 4.7 ppm for 1H and 70 ppm for 13C and a recycle delay of 1.5 s.The detailed methods of other NMR analysis including gradient COSY and 2D H2BC experiments of AHGol and 1D 1H, 2D COSY, two-dimensional 1H-13C edited HSQC, and 1,1 adequate spectra of ABol are listed in ESI.
Conclusions
We constructed an efficient and simple process to upgrade AHG to AHGol as a new platform chemical directly from agarose derived from red macroalgae. This process is enabled by integrating the agarose chemical hydrolysis to AB and the biological conversion of AB in agarose hydrolysate to AHGol. This process completely uses all agarose components in the production of the platform chemical, AHGol, by overcoming limited utilization of the rare sugar, AHG. In addition, the feasibility of AHGol as a platform chemical was validated by converting AHGol to a representative plastic monomer, isosorbide. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which AHG was upgraded for the valorization of red macroalgal biomass in a biorefinery.
