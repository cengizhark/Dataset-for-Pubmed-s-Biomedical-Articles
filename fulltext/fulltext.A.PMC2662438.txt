As of February 2008, thirty-two anti-HIV drugs have been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/virals.html). These compounds include eleven HIV protease inhibitors, seventeen nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, one fusion inhibitor, one entry inhibitor (CCR5 co-receptor antagonist), one integrase inhibitor, and one multi-class combination product. Clinical combinations of these drugs, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of AIDS. However, increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART regimens fail to respond to current antiretroviral drugs due to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants.1 Therefore, it is essential to develop additional potent anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action or resistance profiles different from those of current anti-HIV therapeutics.
In our prior studies, 3',4'-di-O-(S)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (1, DCK, Figure 1) 2 and its analogs were identified as a novel class of anti-HIV agents with potent activity in H9 lymphocytes. Systematic modification of 1 provided more than 150 khellactone derivatives, including mono-, di-, and tri-substituted 1-analogs, and their SAR study results have been published. 3, 4, 5, 6 Notably, mechanistic studies have demonstrated that 1 and its analogs do target HIV-1 RT; however, they do not interfere with its RNA-polymerase activity, but instead inhibit its DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Thus, 1-analogs suppress the production of double-stranded viral DNA from a single-stranded DNA intermediate,7 in stark contrast to current HIV-1 RT inhibitors that block the generation of single-stranded DNA from a RNA template. This unique mechanism of action provides an opportunity to discover a novel NNRTI that remains effective against HIV-1 RT multi-drug resistant strains. Thus, we were strongly prompted to develop additional potent 1-analogs as potential clinical trial candidates.
Due to its high potency and easy synthesis, 4-methyl-DCK (2) was chosen as the first drug candidate for preclinical studies. However, the poor bioavailability of 2 has limited its further development. Subsequently, another promising candidate 3-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-DCK (3, HMDCK) showed moderate bioavailabity, but lacked activity in a drug resistant strain.8 Guided by SAR and 3D-QSAR results,9 our research efforts next focused on the development of drug candidates with better pharmacokinetic profiles and potent anti HIV-1 drug-resistant activity. A cyano group shows good metabolic stability under most conditions. Moreover, it is also a good H-bond acceptor and can favorably interact with Tyr or Ser amino-acid residues on the NNRTI binding site surface, which are critical determinants for several NNRTIs affinities.10 In addition, reported evidence suggests that by introducing a cyano group, such as seen with the potent anti-HIV drug etravirine, the binding affinity of a quinazoline inhibitor to its target (containing Tyr30 and Tyr50) increased dramatically by 30,000-fold, due to hydrogen bond formation between the cyano nitrogen and two phenol hydroxyls of two tyrosines.11 Based on the aforementioned evidence, the 3-cyanomethyl moiety was selected to replace the 3-hydroxymethyl group of 3. As we expected, (3'R,4'R)-3-cyanomethyl-4-methyl-DCK (4) discovered through this study not only exhibited promising potency against wild-type HIV-1 replication in H-9 lymphocytes (Table 4),6 but also showed activity against several resistant strains. In this paper, we report the broad-spectrum anti-HIV potency of 4 against wild-type and drug resistant viral stains, its pharmacokinetic, and a practical synthetic protocol for scale-up synthesis of this promising compound.
Chemistry
As stated above, because 4 is a good potential drug candidate for preclinical studies, a practical synthesis for scale-up of 4 is merited and has been developed. The total yield of 4 was significantly increased from 7.8% in the original seven-step synthesis6 to 32% in the new ten-step synthesis with optimized conditions, as shown in Scheme 1 and Table 1. The key intermediate 3,4-dimethylseselin (11) was originally prepared from 3,4-dimethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (6) by a two-step reaction (see Scheme 1, steps a,b): a) nucleophilic substitution with 3-chloro-3-methyl-1-butyne, followed by b) Claisen rearrangement and cyclization in N,N-diethylaniline at reflux temperature (>200 °C). However, formation of a linear pyranocoumarin isomer was unavoidable, resulting in lower yields and difficult purification in scale-up synthesis. Thus, the following alternative synthetic route was developed to synthesize intermediate 11 exclusively and efficiently. Acetylation of the 7-hydroxyl of 6 with refluxing acetic anhydride provided 7-acetoxycoumarin 7 in 96% yield. By using AlCl3 and slowly heating to 180 °C, 7 underwent Fries arrangement providing 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (8), which was easily purified by crystallization from EtOH, in an 83% yield. Meanwhile, we separated the filtrate by column chromatography to obtain a small amount of 6-acetylated isomer. The structures of 8 and its 6-acetylated isomer were identified by spectroscopic analysis, and HPLC showed that the crystalline 8 was pure, with no 6-acetylated isomer being detected. Condensation of 8 with acetone in the presence of pyrrolidine yielded the fused angular pyranocoumarin 9 in an 81% yield. Reduction of the 4'-carbonyl of 9 with NaBH4 in MeOH yielded 10. Without purification, subsequent dehydration of 10 with TsOH exclusively generated key intermediate 3,4-dimethylseselin 11, which was readily purified by crystallization from EtOH. This current five-step preparation of 11 from 6 has a total yield of 59%, which is much higher than the 38% yield obtained in the original two-step synthesis, even though it is three steps longer. Additionally, this modified route to the key intermediate 11 has additional advantages for scale-up synthesis: it avoids production of the linear isomer, does not require chromatographic purification, and eliminates use of the costly reagent 3-chloro-3-methylbutyne-1 and the environmental contaminant N,N-diethylaniline.
Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation of 11 yielded (3'R,4'R)-3,4-dimethyl-(+)-cis-khellactone, which was dried in vacuo and used directly, without further purification, in the acylation step with (S)-camphanic chloride in pyridine and CH2Cl2. (3'R,4'R)-3,4-Dimethyl-DCK (12) was produced in a two-step yield of ca. 77%, with less than 5% of the (3'S,4'S)-isomer, as measured by HPLC. Compound 12 was treated with N-bromosuccinimide at a mole ratio of 1:1.2 in refluxing benzene for 4 h to produce exclusively 3-bromomethyl-4-methyl-DCK (13)4, 6 in 97% yield. Even though both 3- and 4-methyl groups were present, bromination occurred regioselectively only at the 3-methyl. In addition to 1H NMR shifts, the position of bromination was verified using NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) measurement, in which the signals of a methyl singlet (2.41 ppm, s) and 6-proton (6.80 ppm, d, J = 8.8 Hz) showed obviously increased response of ca. 14% and 12%, respectively, when the 5-proton (7.61 ppm, d, J = 8.8 Hz) was irradiated. This fact indicated that the 3-methyl has higher reactivity than the 4-methyl during free–radical type bromination.
Another major improvement was the cyanation of 13. In our original synthesis, compound 13 was reacted with sodium cyanide in DMSO at 60 °C to give 4 in a 49% yield.6 However, DMSO is an environmental contaminant and not a suitable solvent for scale-up synthesis of a drug candidate, especially when used in the last step. Nitriles are generally prepared by reacting primary alkyl halides with inorganic metal cyanide salts; thus, a suitable solvent system in which both kinds of reagents are soluble is very crucial. We investigated the impact of various solvents and phase-transfer catalysts as shown in Table 2 to find a better solvent system. Accordingly, we tried first to use the polar aprotic solvent anhydrous DMF or acetonitrile rather than DMSO (entries 1 and 2, respectively). After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, both reactions failed because the inorganic sodium cyanide was barely soluble in these solvents. Adding a small amount of water to the DMF (DMF/water 60:1 v/v) greatly increased the solubility of sodium cyanide, resulting in a 75% yield of product (entry 3). However, the 1H NMR spectrum of the product showed two different proton signals (δ 3.72 and 5.27 ppm) for the 3-CH2 in a ratio of ca. 3.5:1, which indicated that the product was a pair of isomers. Each isomeric product could be obtained exclusively by using two-phase CHCl3/H2O in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide (Bu4N+I−) when the reaction was carried out at room temperature (entry 4) or reflux (entry 5, 60–70 °C). The former conditions provided only one product (3-CH2 signal at δ 3.72 ppm) and the latter conditions afforded the other product (3-CH2 signal at δ 5.27 ppm) in 1H NMR spectrum. Additional spectroscopic evidence (13C NMR, MS, and IR spectra) confirmed that the former product was the nitrile 4, and the latter compound was the isonitrile isomer 4b. Their spectroscopic differences are shown in Table 3. Products 4 and 4b had HPLC retention times of 10.9 and 5.6 min, respectively.
Other phase-transfer catalysts, including benzyltriethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylammonium chloride, dibenzo-18-crown-6, and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, were also investigated in the two-phase reaction system (data not shown), but Bu4N+I− gave better results. Addition of Bu4N+I− directly into DMF (entry 6) or acetonitrile (entry 7) improved the solubility of sodium cyanide and gave moderate yields of nitrile and isonitrile, respectively, compared with failed entries 1 and 2. Furthermore, the effects of other polar aprotic or protic solvents with or without Bu4N+I− (entries 8–13) were investigated. Different solvents afforded either nitrile 4 or isonitrile 4b exclusively. EtOH [containing water or anhydrous, with or without Bu4N+I− (entries 10–13)] showed high yields of nitrile 4. Because EtOH is safe and inexpensive, it is usually a good solvent choice for scale-up synthesis. However, compound 13 had limited solubility in EtOH when the reaction scale was increased. Thus, a mixed solvent system of 95% EtOH/DMF (3:2 v/v) (entry 14) was developed. Alkyl bromide 13, which is soluble in DMF, was added slowly to an EtOH solution of sodium cyanide over a 10–15 min period. After 2 h stirring at room temperature, this reaction produced only the expected cyanide 4 in a 74% yield. The [α] value of pure 4 is +22.81° in chloroform, in which 3'S,4'S stereoisomer of 4 was measured less than 0.5% by HPLC.
Results and Discussion
Broad-spectrum Anti-HIV ActivityIn our previous studies, compound 4 exhibited similar potency to parent compounds 2 and 3, but lower toxicity in HIV-1IIIB infected H9 lymphocytes assay (Table 4).4,6 In the current study, we further tested compound 4 in other different assays, including laboratory-adapted, primary isolates and drug-resistant strains (Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7). It should be noted that, due to different protocols, the current assay is less sensitive. Further screening results indicate that compound 4 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against infection of CD4+ T cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates. The inhibitory activity of 4 on infection of CD4+ T cells and, MT-2 and MT-4 cells by laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains IIIB and Lai (X4-tropic virus), and Bal (R5-tropic virus) was determined as previously described.12,13 The in vitro cytotoxicity of 4 was assessed using a XTT assay.14 As shown in Table 5 and Table 7, compound 4 significantly inhibited infection by both X4- and R5-tropic viruses with EC50 values at sub-micromolar levels and selective index (SI) values ranging from 66 to 182. Subsequently, we sought to determine whether 4 is also effective against HIV-1 variants resistant to RTIs. As shown in Table 6, compound 4 had an EC50 of approximately 4 µM, for inhibiting infection by HIV-1 7324-1, which is a panel of fourteen prototypical infectious multidrug resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) clones, including those with each of the published nucleoside analog RT mutations in the combinations that occur most frequently in HIV-infected individuals.15 This value is about eight-fold higher than that against infection by wild-type HIV-1 IIIB. This result suggests that the multi-drug resistant HIV-1 variant is only moderately resistant to 4, confirming that the newly synthesized 4 is an RTI with better resistance profiles than other RTIsCD4+ T lymphocytes in PBMCs are the primary target cells for HIV-1 infection. Based on the HIV-1 envelope gene sequences, primary HIV-1 isolates can be classified into different genotypes, i.e. Group M subtypes A – H and Group O.16, 17, 18 A, C, D and G subtypes predominate in sub-Saharan Africa19, E subtype in Thailand,20 and B subtype in the United States and Western Europe.21 HIV-1 isolates can be further classified into R5-, X4- and dual (R5X4)-tropic viruses, which use CXCR4, CCR4 or both coreceptors, respectively.17, 22, 23 We tested the inhibitory activity of 4 on infection by a series of primary HIV-1 isolates. As shown in Table 7, compound 4 significantly inhibited infection of PBMCs by all primary HIV-1 isolates tested, including subtypes A, B, C, D, G, and group O with R5- and X4R5 dual-tropisms. The EC50 values for inhibition of HIV-1 infection in PBMCs ranged from 0.8 to 10 µM. These results suggest that 4 has potent antiviral activity against a broad-spectrum of HIV-1 isolates.
Pharmacokinetic StudiesTo be a useful anti-HIV drug candidate, a compound must be able to penetrate the cell membrane in order to interfere with replication steps inside the cell. In a colonic adenocarcinoma cell (Caco-2) assay, 4 had an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 5.16 × 10−6, indicating that it can readily penetrate the cell membrane.In in vivo studies, compound 4 was administered via intravenous (i.v. 2 mg/kg) and oral (i.g. suspension, 20 mg/kg) routes to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–200 g). Nine blood samples (0.4 mL) were collected sequentially over an 8-h period and immediately centrifuged. The separated plasma samples were stored at −20 °C for analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis by using DAS Version 2.0. Initially, compounds 3 and 4 were administered as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) suspensions, and although both compounds showed fairly low absorption in vivo, 4 was clearly better than 3 (Figure 2). To improve solubility and thus increase absorption in vivo, compound 4 was then administered in 10% poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) 400 to rats via intravenous and oral routes. Using this administration vehicle, 4 exhibited moderate oral bioavailability (F = 17.8%) in the rat, as shown in Table 8 and Figure 3. Meanwhile, compound 4 also showed low systemic clearance (0.052 L/min/kg) and a moderate half time (167 min). Thus, current results indicate that the presence of the cyano moiety resulted in improved molecular pharmaceutical properties and provided lower lipophilicity, low systemic clearances, additional absorption, and longer half-life, subsequently enhancing oral bioavailability. Therefore, compound 4 should be further developed as a potential drug candidate.
Conclusions
Drug-resistance has become a critical problem in the development of new NNRTIs. However, further modification of 2 has led to the identification of 4 as a new promising lead for anti-HIV preclinical studies. It possesses not only potent antiviral activity against infection of CD4+ T cell lines and PBMCs by both laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates with distinct subtypes and tropisms, but also moderate efficacy against multi-drug resistant HIV strains. In addition, a practical 10-step synthesis of 4 was successfully developed and optimized. In particular, the preparation of the key intermediate 11 and the cyanation in the final step were greatly improved. The modified synthesis gave a high overall yield of 32%, with minimized isomer formation, simplified purification, and elimination of high-cost reagents and toxic solvents, thus providing clear advantages for further scale-up synthesis. Pharmacokinetic studies also indicated that 4 has moderate oral bioavailability and cell permeability, and a reasonable half-life. All current results suggest that 4 has potential for development into an anti-HIV clinical trials candidate.

Detection of HIV-1 replication as measured by p24 antigen productionMT-2 and MT-4 cells, laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains and primary HIV-1 isolates were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The inhibitory activity of compounds on HIV-1 infection was determined as previously described.24 In brief, 1 × 104 MT-2 cells were infected with an HIV-1 strain (100 TCID50) in 200 µL RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of a test compound at graded concentrations overnight. Then, the culture supernatants were removed and fresh media containing no test compounds were added. On the fourth day post-infection, 100 µL of culture supernatants were collected from each well, mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100 and assayed for p24 antigen, which was quantitated by ELISA. Briefly, wells of polystyrene plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex Technology, Chantilly, VA) were coated with HIV immunoglobulin (HIVIG), which was prepared from plasma of HIV-seropositive donors with high neutralizing titers against HIV-1IIIB, in 0.085 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight, followed by washes with washing buffer (0.01M PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) and blocking with PBS containing 1% dry fat-free milk (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). Virus lysates were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After extensive washes, anti-p24 mAb (183-12H-5C), biotin labeled anti-mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, CA), streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Zymed, S. San Francisco, CA), and the substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) were added sequentially. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1N H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader (Ultra 386, TECAN, Research Triangle Park, NC). Recombinant protein p24 purchased from US Biological (Swampscott, MA) was included for establishing standard dose response curves. Each sample was tested in triplicate. The percentage of inhibition of p24 production was calculated as previously described.25 The effective concentrations for 50% inhibition (EC50) were calculated using a computer program, designated CalcuSyn26, kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Chou (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York).Inhibitory activity of compound 4 against infection of PBMCs by a primary HIV-1 isolate was determined as previously described.27 Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from the blood of healthy donors at the New York Blood Center by standard density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). The cells were cultured in 75 cm2 plastic flasks at 37 °C for 2 h. The non-adherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells in 10 mL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and 100 U/mL IL-2 (Sigma), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 days. The PHA-stimulated cells were infected with a primary HIV-1 isolate at a 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the presence or absence of the test compound at graded concentrations. Culture media were changed on the second day and then every three days. The supernatants were collected seven days post-infection and tested for p24 antigen by ELISA as described above. The percent inhibition of p24 production and EC50 values were calculated as described above.
Assessment of in vitro cytotoxicityThe in vitro cytotoxicity of compounds on MT-2 cells was measured by XTT assay.15 Briefly, 100 µL of the test compound at graded concentrations were added to equal volumes of cells (5 × 105/mL) in wells of 96-well plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 days, 50 µL of XTT solution (1 mg/mL) containing 0.02 µM of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) was added. After 4 h, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with an ELISA reader. The CC50 (concentration for 50% cytotoxicity) values were calculated using a computer program, CalcuSyn.28
Pharmacokinetic assessmentsChromatographic analyses were performed using a Gold ODS-C18 column (3 µm, 150 × 2.1 mm, Hypersil™ Thermo USA) kept at 20 °C, the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile–water–formic acid in the ratio of 65:35:0.1 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Acetonitrile was HPLC grade and other chemical reagents and solvents were of analytical grade. A Thermo Finnigan TSQ tandem mass spectrometer equipped with ESI source (San Jose, CA, USA) and Surveyor LC pump were used for LC–MS/MS analysis. Data acquisition and data processing were performed by using Xcalibur software and LCQuan 2.0 data analysis program (Thermo Finnigan), respectively. Optimized MS parameters were as below: 4500 v spray voltage, 12.6 psi sheath gas pressure, 3.3 psi auxiliary valve flow, and 280 °C of capillary temperature. The selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used and transitions selected for quantification were as follows: m/z 698.0→m/z 292.8 for test compounds and m/z 285.1→m/z 138.0 for internal standard (IS) synthesized by pharmaceutical laboratory. Optimized collision energy of 47 eV was used for test compounds and 21 eV for IS. Scan time was 0.5 s per transition. Solutions of test compounds and IS were infused into the mass spectrometer.
Preparation of samplesUsing a simple protein precipitation method, a test compound was extracted from rat plasma. Plasma samples for standard curves were prepared by spiking 100 µL of rat plasma with 50 µL various concentrations of each test compound ranging from 10 to 10000 ng/mL and a constant volume (50 µL) of the internal standard (IS) (2 µg/mL in acetonitrile). The final concentrations of standards were set to 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 1000, 2000, and 5000 ng/mL. To each tested plasma sample (100 µL), 50 µL of the same concentration of IS was added. The plasma was then mixed with 400 µL of acetonitrile. After vortexing and centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials, and only 5 µL of the supernatant was injected into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis. The calibration curve y = ax + b was obtained by assigning the concentration of T and the peak area ratio of T to I.S. and to x and y, respectively. Subsequently, a 1/x weighted linear regression was performed. The amount of each test compound in the plasma samples was back-calculated using the standard curves.
In vivo animal testThree male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in each study. Each of these rats was dosed with a testing compound at 20 mg/kg for i.g. administration and 2 mg/kg for i.v. administration each in CMC. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min (Figure 2) and were immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma fractions. When compound 4 was administrated in 10% PEG400, the blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, 480, and 720 min (Figure 3). The plasma samples obtained were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Concentration-versus-time profiles were obtained for each analyte, and standard non-compartmental analysis was performed on the data using DAS Version 2.0 to recover the area under the curve (AUC) and other non-compartmental parameters. Bioavailability was estimated by dividing the dose-normalized AUC (0 - t) resulting from oral administration by the AUC (0 - t) resulting from intravenous administration (where t is the last time point with measurable drug concentrations in the study). Data for each pharmacokinetic parameter were averaged and reported as mean ± standard deviation. Calibration curves for testing compounds in plasma were linear in the concentration range of 5–5000 ng/mL, with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.990 for all curves.
Caco-2 cell experimentCaco-2 monolayers exhibiting a transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value of more than 300 Ωcm2 were used within 21 days post-seeding. The culture medium was removed from both apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) sides and the monolayers were washed twice with warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium. The monolayers were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator with pre-warmed transport media. The transport medium consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt solution (HBSS), 10 mM HEPES buffer, 25 mM D-glucose, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. Testing compounds at final concentrations of 10 mM in HBSS were added to the apical compartment. The basolateral compartment contained only HBSS. All transport studies were conducted in the AP to BL direction. At selected times, ranging from 10 to 60 min, 50 µL of samples were removed from the BL compartment for analysis and replaced with an equal volume of HBSS. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The initial flux of the drug (J) was determined from the slope of the linear plot of the cumulative amount of drug transported versus time. Permeability was estimated by calculating the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp)29 according to: Papp = J/ASC0, in which C0 is the initial concentration in the donor compartment and AS is the surface area of the monolayer.
