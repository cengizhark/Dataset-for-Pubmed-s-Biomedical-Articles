INTRODUCTION
Visual information is transmitted from the retina through the mammalian dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) (Sherman and Guillery, 1996; Sherman, 2001), to primary visual cortex (V1). Thalamocortical projections primarily innervate dendrites within layer 4 (L4) (Friedlander and Martin, 1989; Friedlander et al., 1991; Stratford et al., 1996; Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997; Gil et al., 1999; Erisir and Dreusicke, 2005). About 90% of the geniculocortical synapses terminate onto L4 neuron dendrites (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979; Peters and Payne, 1993; Peters et al., 1994; Stratford et al., 1996; Binzegger et al., 2004). Intracortical information processing has serial and parallel components (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Gilbert, 1983, 1993; Callaway, 1998; Martin, 2002; Thomson and Bannister, 2003), through vertical interlaminar and horizontal intralaminar projections (Lund et al., 1979; Ahmed et al., 1994; Lubke et al., 2000). Information is then sent from V1 to other cortical areas largely by L2/3 pyramidal cells (Horton, 1984; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Gilbert, 1993; Schmidt et al., 1997; Sincich and Blasdel, 2001).
There is considerable synaptic integration within L4 (Gilbert, 1983; Martin, 2002), including both horizontal excitatory and inhibitory projections (Hirsch and Martinez, 2006). Although the properties of intralaminar synaptic connections in visual cortex within supragranular and infragranular layers have been studied (Markram et al., 1997; Mercer et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005; Feldmeyer et al., 2006; Hardingham et al., 2007), less is known about the functional synaptic properties within L4 in visual cortex (Stratford et al., 1996; Tarczy-Hornoch et al., 1999), although these connections represent a substantial fraction of the synapses within L4. It has been estimated that ∼45% of the dendritic spines of L4 excitatory neurons receive input from adjacent L4 excitatory cells (Ahmed et al., 1994; Bruno and Sakmann, 2006), compared to ∼10% that receive input from thalamocortical fibers (Ahmed et al., 1994). Moreover, L4 has been hypothesized to act as an amplifier of thalamocortical inputs (Martin, 2002). In order to directly evaluate individual L4 cells’ synaptic outputs (unitary synaptic connections), we used multiple simultaneous patch-clamp recording from 2−4 L4 neurons. Over 100 pairs of such unitary synaptic connections were assessed this way. Quantal analysis was applied in a subset of experiments. We also recorded from sets of triplets of synaptically connected L4 and from a smaller group of L4 to supragranular connected cell pairs.
There was considerable variability among unitary synaptic connections between L4 excitatory neurons. Individual synaptic strengths ranged from 0.42pA to 192.92pA. Connections were, on average, reliable, with an average failure rate of 25% but a subset of weaker connections (<5pA average peak amplitude) had failure rates >50%. Most connections (79%) were best fit best by a quantal or binomial model of synaptic transmission. Connections between L4 and supragranular layers were similar to those within L4 in their reliability and strength. Multiple release sites on a common presynaptic L4 neuron's axon behaved independently on individual simultaneously recorded trials while properties of synaptic connections from or onto a common cell were no more functionally similar than connections between separate cell pairs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Slice preparationAll experiments were performed according to guidelines by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine and followed the NIH Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Tri-color guinea pigs of ages p6−14 were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of 0.85mg/kg ketamine and 0.15mg/kg xylazine and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and cooled for at least 90 seconds in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 KH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 11 dextrose, and saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. Coronal slices of the visual cortex were cut at 300 μm with a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). Slices were incubated at 33−35°C for 45−60 min in a holding chamber in a heated water bath (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and then transferred to a room temperature bath until being transferred to a submerged recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and perfused continuously at 2−3 ml/min with oxygenated aCSF at 32−34°C. Neurons were visualized with a Zeiss upright microscope (Axioskope FS1; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an Achroplan 40x 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion lens set up for Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.Glass micropipettes (Corning 7056 glass; 1.5 OD, 1.12 ID; A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) were pulled on a vertical puller (PP-830; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to an open tip resistance of 2.5−4.0 MΩ and filled with a pipette solution containing (in mM) 115 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 4 phosphocreatine-Na, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 by KOH. Osmolarity was adjusted to 280−290 mOsm with mannitol. Biocytin (0.3−0.5%, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to this solution to identify recorded cells and confirm their position. The relative positioning of recorded cells was noted to allow for posterior matching of anatomical and electrophysiological data. After the experiment was completed, the slices were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. After overnight fixation, sections were incubated in an avidin/biotin/HRP complex overnight at 4°C with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Vector Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed using DAB (Vector Laboratories). The tissue was counterstained with Cresyl violet and cover slipped with DPX (EM Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA). Laminar location of the cells was then determined. Whenever a pair of biocytin-stained preand postsynaptic neurons were unequivocally identified in the slice and matched with the corresponding electrophysiological recording, their axonal and dendritic arbors were reconstructed using Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VA). Putative synaptic contacts were identified in with light microscopy with a high-magnification (100x) oil-immersion objective as the close juxtaposition of a presynaptic bouton on an axonal branch belonging to an identified presynaptic neuron and a dendritic branch or spine belonging to a corresponding postsynaptic neuron. The number of such putative synaptic contacts was counted, and the dendritic distance from the putative contact to the soma of the postsynaptic cell was also calculated. These estimates at the LM level are a maximum number of potential contacts as EM analysis would be necessary to verify synapses.
ElectrophysiologyAll recordings were made with two MultiClamp 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), and signals were digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata digitizer 1440A and recorded using Clampex 9 or 10 software (Molecular Devices). Recordings were filtered on-line at 4 kHz with a four-pole Bessel low-pass filter. Layer 4 was identified under light and DIC microscopy on the basis of its differential opacity to transmitted light and the smaller size and greater density of L4 compared to L5 somata. Cells with membrane potentials more positive than −60 mV and recordings with high access resistance (>40 MΩ or >20% the value of the input resistance for that cell) were discarded. After a pair of cells was patch-clamped, one of them was held under current clamp and pairs of action potentials were elicited with a 30 ms inter-spike interval with two 5ms square-pulse depolarizing current injections (typically 300−800 pA) at 0.2 Hz. The putative postsynaptic cell was held under voltage clamp at −70 mV. We chose to record the unitary synaptic currents under voltage clamp (vs. recording synaptic potentials under current clamp) for better signal to noise and detection of small events for quantal analysis. If an evoked post-synaptic unitary current (uEPSC) response was not apparent immediately, at least 50 (and often over 100) trials were collected, spike-trigger averaged phase locked to the peak of the action potential in the putative presynaptic cell and examined again. If a response was detected, data collection proceeded for at least 10 minutes. If no response was observed in response to the first or second presynaptic action potential, the configuration was reversed with the original putative postsynaptic cell tested for input onto the original putative presynaptic cell. If a response was not observed in either direction, the cells were considered not functionally connected and a third cell was patched and examined as a potential pre- and postsynaptic partner to the other two. If necessary, a fourth cell was patched and tried as many times as necessary until at least a synaptic connection was found. Occasionally, multiple synaptic connections were found and simultaneously (if possible) or sequentially recorded. Connections were analyzed off-line by placing a 0.4 ms window (noise measurement) in the postsynaptic current trace 2−3 ms before the action potential onset in the presynaptic channel and a second window, time-locked to the first one, around the peak of the average uEPSC response (EPSC measurement). Latency was measured from the presynaptic AP peak to the onset of the uEPSC deflection as defined by 10% of the rise time to uEPSC peak. Half-width of the uEPSC trace, 10−90% rise time, decay time and charge of the synaptic connection were all analyzed on a trial-by-trial basis and then averaged after discarding trials containing synaptic failures. Several methods were used to estimate failures (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Quantal analysis was the most rigorous method for failure rate estimation, but since it was limited to connections with ≥100 trials, we used two other measures of failure rate, as well: 1) the proportion of trials with uEPSC amplitudes below 2 standard deviations of the noise and 2) double the proportion of trials with positive uEPSC measurements (assuming that noise measurements are symmetrically distributed around 0). We compared these estimates with those from quantal analysis for those pairs with over 100 recorded trials and found that the first method resulted in a significant over-estimation of failure rates (p<0.01, Wilcoxon test; see Supplementary Fig. S1), whereas the second one did not (p = 0.18, Wilcoxon test). Therefore, unless otherwise noted, we used the latter method. Analyses were performed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and R 2.71 (R Development Core Team; Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Differences in synaptic parameters in triplet recordingsIn a subset of experiments we recorded from pairs of connected cells with a common presynaptic (divergent triplets) or postsynaptic (convergent triplets) cell. We computed the differences in synaptic parameters between pairs of connections in divergent or convergent triplets. We compared uEPSC strength (averaged peak amplitude of all trials including failures), failure rate (see above) and uEPSC potency (averaged peak amplitude of only successful synaptic transmission trials excluding failures). These differences were statistically compared with a similar number of differences obtained by randomly selecting pairs of strength and failure rate values from our whole L4-L4 database. This statistical comparison between the differences in triplet pairs and differences between random pairs of connections was repeated 105 times and probability of obtaining a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the two sets recorded.
Analysis of simultaneous triplet recordingsIn some of the divergent triplets the three connected cells were recorded simultaneously such that a presynaptic action potential could evoke a postsynaptic response in both of its postsynaptic partners simultaneously. In these experiments we performed trial-by-trial analysis of synaptic failures by determining the proportion of presynaptic activations in response to which a response could be observed in both of the postsynaptic cells. Subsequently, the observed proportions of coincident successful events (p(raUrb)) were compared to those calculated from the failure rate for each connection assuming independent probabilities in either connection (p(r)a p(r)b).
Quantal analysisUnbiased quantal analysis methods were used to analyze the PSC evoked by the first action potential in which ≥100 trials were collected. A full account of the analysis methods used in this study has been described in others’ studies (Stricker and Redman, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004). Briefly, both the noise and uEPSC measurements were converted into probability density functions (PDFs) using a Gaussian kernel estimator by convolving each measurement with a normal distribution. The noise PDF, which is frequently skewed presumably due to contamination of the measurement by spontaneous currents, was fit by two Gaussian distributions by using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The resulting fit was considered as a “model peak” which accounts for intracellular and experimental noise. Following current models of synaptic transmission in the cortex, the observed uEPSC response distribution was assumed to be due to a real fluctuation of the response between a number of possible discrete amplitudes (due to probabilistic release at an unknown number of release sites) superimposed with recording and intracellular noise. We therefore sought to determine the optimal number of underlying discrete amplitudes that account for the observed distribution. This was achieved first by sequentially fitting an increasing number K of different model peaks using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Increasing the number of peaks increases the likelihood of the fit at the cost of introducing additional degrees of freedom in the model. Because we sought to obtain the minimal number of peaks that correctly fit the observed distribution without introducing unnecessary complexity, we compared the different models in pairs to determine if the fits were significantly different using a Wilkes statistic computed from the log-likelihoods of the H0 (the model with the lower number of peaks) and H1 models. Since this is a non-nested comparison between mixture models with different number of peaks, the Wilkes statistic is not asymptotically distributed as a χ2 random variable, so we performed Monte Carlo simulations to generate its distribution. By comparing pairs of models, eventually an optimal model of peaks is obtained. This initial fit was the unconstrained model, since no restrictions were imposed on the locations or weights of the peaks. Once this optimal K was obtained, a quantal model (in which the peaks are forced to be equally distanced by a separation q, corresponding to the quantal content of a synaptic vesicle) was fit to the uEPSC PDF and compared to the unconstrained model. Typically, the compared quantal and unconstrained models had a similar number of peaks, and the comparison could be handled with a χ2 test instead of a Monte Carlo simulation. If H0 couldn’t be rejected, a quantal model was assumed. Finally, a third model was tested in which the release sites mediating the connection were assumed to be independent and have the same release probability p (binomial model). Since no valid estimates could be made about the real number of release sites mediating connections with a failure rate of 0, these were not fitted to a binomial model. Again, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain the distribution of the Wilks statistic. In this way, every analyzed synaptic connection was assigned to one of three models (unconstrained, quantal or binomial) and a different number of synaptic parameters were extracted depending on the model: number of peaks, failure rate, quantal size q (for quantal and binomial connections) and release probability p (for binomial connections).
RESULTS
DatabaseWe recorded from 117 L4 to L4 and 9 L4 to L 2/3 (n=8) or L1 (n=1) cell pairs. Based on several criteria (see below), 28 of the L4-L4 pairs and 2 of the L4-supragranular pairs were excluded from the analysis. Reasons for exclusion were: i) anatomical reconstruction identified one of the cells to be in L5 (n = 15); ii) one of the cells was a presumptive inhibitory neuron based on fast spikes, lack of spike frequency adaptation in response to a sustained depolarization and high input resistance (McCormick et al., 1985; Thomson and Deuchars, 1997; Contreras and Palmer, 2003); n = 3); iii) less than 50 stable trials were recorded or one of the cells had high access resistance (>25% of the cell's input resistance) or was otherwise unhealthy (i.e. maintaining voltage clamp at −70 mV required injection of >200 pA or access resistance changed by more than 20%; n=12). The remaining 96 connected cell pairs (89 connected L4-L4 cell pairs and 7 connected L4-supragranular cell pairs) form the database utilized in this study. Reciprocal connections were rare (n = 3 L4-L4 connections) in our study, compared to an earlier report (Lubke et al, 2000). There are several possibilities for this difference including the species used (guinea pig vs. rat), possible differences between connectivity of spiny stellates (Lubke et al., 2000) and pyramidal neurons (our study) or the search protocol. In our study, once a connection was validated, the responses were recorded for an extended period to perform the quantal analysis (and in many cases, also were subjected to a plasticity induction protocol for purposes of another study) before the reciprocal connection was tested. Thus, in many cases, we were simply not able to adequately evaluate the reciprocal connection, making our estimates a lower bound on the number of reciprocal connected pairs.
Example resultsAn example of a pair of synaptically connected L4 neurons that were also successfully filled with biocytin and reconstructed is illustrated in Figure 1. Four cells that were patched, filled with biocytin and tested for connectivity are visible in the field of view (photomicrograph in Fig. 1A and drawing in Fig. 1B). Of all twelve possible interactions tested (six sets of putative bidirectional interactions), three were functionally connected. Figure 1C shows example individual trial responses (top 25 traces) and the averaged response from 120 trials (second from bottom trace) recorded from the postsynaptic cell (green cell in Fig. 1B) in response to pairs of action potentials (bottom trace) evoked in the presynaptic cell (orange cell in Fig. 1B). The quadruple patch clamp recording setup is schematized in Figure 1D. The peak amplitudes of the evoked responses to the first spike on individual trials over 10 minutes (120 trials) are represented as a time plot in Figure 1E. Note that in this particular example the unitary EPSC peak amplitudes (uEPSCs) on individual trials vary between −5 and −20 pA with very few failures of synaptic transmission. Throughout the paper we refer to the average peak amplitude of the uEPSC evoked by the first action potential for all trials as the strength and to the average peak amplitude of the uEPSC evoked by the first action potential only on trials with successful transmission events (excluding failures – see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for comparison of methods of failure analysis) as the potency. All four cells in this experiment (including the connected pairs) had pyramidal morphology, consistent with most L4 cells that were successfully recorded and filled with biocytin (see Discussion). Only a very small proportion of the anatomically reconstructed cells had a stellate morphology (2/118; see Discussion). In order to compare our data from guinea pig visual cortex to results from other studies of L4 cortical neurons in different species and sensory cortical areas and to estimate the functional implications of intralaminar synaptic convergence (see Discussion), we counted the number of dendritic spines on a subset (n=6) of our cells (mean = 2,524_± 413 SD; n=6) and found them to be similar to reports from L4 cells in rat barrel cortex (2800; Lubke et al., 2000; Bruno and Sakmann, 2006) and in cat visual cortex (∼3000 for pyramidal cells; Ahmed et al., 1994; Binzegger et al., 2004).
Analysis of evoked uEPSCsExample records illustrating the measurement of uEPSC waveform parameters are shown in Figure 2. The measurement criteria for rise time (10−90% RT), decay time constant (τDT), half width (HW) and latency are indicated for the response evoked by the first presynaptic spike for this L4-L4 cell pair (Fig. 2A). The distributions of these parameters including the peak amplitudes of the evoked uEPSCs, the transmission failure rates and responses to paired presynaptic stimuli of the 89 connected L4-L4 cell pairs are summarized in Figures 2 B-H and 3E and G. The uEPSCs had fast rise times consistent with excitatory glutamatergic transmission (10−90% rise time average = 1.42 ± 0.90ms; median = 1.15 ms – Fig. 2B); the decay phase of the uEPSCs was adequately fit by a single exponential (average decay time constant, tau - τDT= 4.88 ± 3.22 ms; median = 4.30 ms – Fig. 2C); the average half-width of the uEPSCs was 2.53 ± 1.74 ms with a median of 2.06 ms, (Fig. 2D). The average strength (peak amplitudes of all trials including failures) for these L4-L4 unitary connections was 21.18 ± 31.65 pA, with individual values ranging over almost three orders of magnitude, from 0.42 pA to 192.92 pA. The distribution of strengths, however, is skewed (Fig. 2E), and the median strength was only 7.55 pA. When failures are excluded from the analysis, the average peak amplitude (potency) was 23.65 ± 30.87 pA with a range from 3.03 to 192.92 pA (Fig. 2F); and the median potency was 10.48 pA. For the largest average peak amplitude recorded, strength equals potency =192.92 pA, indicative of the perfect fidelity of transmission in the strongest synaptic connections (as described in more detail in Fig. 3E below). We analyzed the anatomical distance of the putative synaptic inputs of our pairs (see Supplementary Figs. S2 and S4) relative to the rise time of the uEPSCs (see Discussion). We found no significant relationship, either when the average distance from the soma to all of the putative anatomical synaptic sites for each pair was measured (R2 = −0.15, p=0.89; n=9 pairs) or when the distance of the closest putative anatomical synaptic site (which might dominate rise time) was measured (R2 = −0.14; p=0.95; n=9 pairs). Interestingly, all of the putative anatomical synaptic contacts were located along basilar dendrites within 150 μm of the soma.The paired pulse behavior of the L4-L4 connections was dominated by depression (PPD, data points below the unity line in Figures 2G and 2H; n = 60/89,or 67% of the L4 pairs tested) while a minority of connections (n = 29/89, 33%) showed paired-pulse potentiation (PPF). The correlation between the peak amplitudes of the first and second uEPSC (R2 = 0.97, p < 0.01) is illustrated in Figure 2G. The region of smaller amplitudes is expanded for clarity in Figure 2H where it is evident that PPF occurred primarily for the smaller uEPSCs while connections greater than 10 pA almost exclusively exhibited PPD.
Reliability of connectionsSince quantal analysis was limited to connections with over 100 recorded trials (n = 75/89 L4-L4 connected cell pairs), we used the method of double the number of positive (outward) current events in the evoked uEPSC measurement window as an estimate of failure rate. The two methods for estimating failures (quantal analysis and the method of doubling the number of events with positive outward currents) were not significantly different (26 ± 26% for double proportion of positive events and 19 ± 22% for quantal analysis – p = 0.18, Wilcoxon test; see Supplementary Fig. S1). Synaptic transmission failure rates ranged from 100% (connections in which no response was elicited during the recording period but for which we were able to detect an evoked uEPSC in response to the second presynaptic spike in the paired pulse paradigm) to 0%. These connections with perfect fidelity of transmission showed a postsynaptic response every time the presynaptic cell produced an action potential, but this does not imply that glutamate release occurred in response to every action potential at all the release sites mediating the connection. Indeed, quantal analysis indicates that individual release sites are not very reliable (see Fig.6C) and so the reliability of these connections might be explained by the existence of numerous release sites (see Fig.5D). Reliable connections were predominant - 17% of the connections had failure rates ≥ 50% with an average failure rate of 25 ± 26% (median = 17%). In a subset (21/89, or 24%) of the connections, no failures occurred (example in Fig. 3A and 3B; strength and potency = 88.90 pA). This was particularly apparent in connections with large average amplitude responses (n = 15/17 connections with responses > 30 pA); the other two connections with responses above 30 pA were still very reliable with failure rates of 1% and 4%, respectively. The average strength (and potency) for connections with a failure rate = 0% was 61.11 pA.For the smaller amplitude connections (0.42 to 25.01 pA; n = 67), the failure rates were higher ranging from 5% to 100% (example illustrated in Figs. 3C and 3D; strength = 4.57 pA; failure rate = 41%). More than a third (n = 31/89, 35%) of the L4-L4 connections had strengths below 5 pA. The relationship between failure rate and strength and potency for the entire population of connections studied is shown in Figure 3E with the area around the smaller uEPSCs (up to 25 pA) expanded in Figure 3G to show the individual strength and potency as a function of failure rate for each uEPSC. Observe that any particular set of synapses between a pair of connected neurons with moderate to high failure rates may have high potencies (e.g. the average uEPSC amplitude only when successful transmission occurs). The interaction of failure rate and potency gives rise to the overall average strength of the unitary synaptic connections as evaluated over multiple trials. Thus, it is of interest to evaluate these parameters independently to separate their respective contributions. An example of this type of analysis is illustrated in the two lower traces in Figure 3C where the averaged response of all trials (synaptic strength with failures included) is shown above in dark grey and the averaged response for only the trials with successful transmission (synaptic potency) is shown below in black. The strongest connection illustrated in Fig. 3A responded to paired pulse inputs with depression (blue points in Fig. 3F) while the weaker connection illustrated in Fig. 3C responded to paired pulse inputs with facilitation (black traces in Fig. 3F).
Latency of unitary responsesIn order to better understand the temporal dynamics of information transfer within the excitatory networks of layer 4, we measured the latency (Fig. 4) of unitary synaptic transmission. Individual trials from pairs with weak connections were too noisy to extract meaningful data on an individual trial basis, so we limited this analysis to pairs with average strengths > 10 pA. Latency was measured on a trial-by-trial basis as the time from the presynaptic action potential peak to the 10% rising phase of the evoked response. The grand mean ± SD of each connected cell pair's mean latencies was 1.30 ± 0.91 ms; the median was 1.12 ms (Fig. 4A), consistent with monosynaptic connections (see Supplemental Fig. S2). The average uEPSC peak amplitude and average latency were correlated for individual connected cell pairs, such that weaker connections tended to show longer latencies (Fig 4B) as has been previously described for L5 cortical neurons (Boudkkazi et al., 2007). When the latency and peak uEPSC amplitude values from all trials for all connected L4 cell pairs are normalized to the average values for that connection and then averaged after binning in normalized uEPSC increments (Fig. 4C), the data for uEPSC peak amplitude vs. latency is best fit by a logarithmic decay function (y = −0.32 * log(x) + 0.982; p < 0.01). The correlation with uEPSC peak amplitude is not limited to the mean latency value as the standard deviation or jitter of the trial-by-trial latency measurements are also dependent on the average size of the uEPSC peak (Fig.4D). For example, the mean and standard deviation of the latency was highest for small (< 20 pA) connections (mean = 2.07 ± 1.02ms). In contrast, the mean value for pairs with responses > 30 pA was 0.85 ± 0.46ms (p < 0.01, Student's t-test). Therefore, large reliable connections (> 30 pA) between L4 cells produce responses that precede smaller inputs (< 20 pA) by 1.22 ms on average and are less temporally variable. Interestingly, neither connection strength, potency, failure rate nor latency (Fig.4) was related to the distance between the pre- and postsynaptic somata (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Failure rate and quantal parametersIn our quantal analysis protocol, every analyzed pair was fitted to three different models - unconstrained, quantal and binomial. The three different models were statistically compared (see Materials and Methods) in order to find out which most adequately explains the data with the minimal assumptions. Figure 5 A1-A3 shows the three different fits to the probability density function (PDF) for an example L4-L4 connected cell pair for which the quantal model was eventually chosen. The unconstrained model, which allows extraction of the failure rate and estimated number of release sites, was the chosen model for 16 of the 75 analyzed cases (21%). Results from an example connection that was optimally fit by an unconstrained model are shown in Figure 5B1. The quantal model allows extraction of quantal size (in pA) that corresponds to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter; this model was chosen for 30 of 75 cases (40%). An example is shown in Figure 5B2. Note the evenly spaced distribution of the modeled peaks, corresponding to the connection quantal size. The binomial model was optimal for 29 (39%) of the studied connections, for which the individual release site probabilities could be extracted. An example is illustrated in Figure 5B3. Figure 5C illustrates the distribution of optimal models for all connections (n = 89), as well as what information (quantal parameters) was extracted for each model.All quantal models allowed for determination of connection failure rate (Supplementary Fig. S1). The failure rate of a connection is partially determined by the number of release sites in the connection, such that connections with a higher number of release sites are more reliable. In an attempt to try to relate the quantal analysis results on the number of release sites modeled to the putative anatomical synaptic connections between cells, we carefully reconstructed the axonal arborizations and dendritic arbors of the functionally connected cell pairs. An example of this is illustrated in figure 5D showing the relationship of failure rate to the number of putative release sites (black points) as determined by anatomical reconstruction of putative synaptic contacts (Supplemental Fig. S4A) and as determined by quantal analysis (orange points). We are very sensitive to the limitations of this approach in terms of potentially grossly over-estimating the number of anatomical synaptic connections as the light microscope is only a limited tool for his type of approach. However, since high quality electron microscopic reconstruction of synapses was not possible due to the whole cell, submergerd brain slice preparation, we were limited to this approach. Connection failure rates spanned the full range, from 0% to 100%. The average value obtained by quantal analysis was 26 ± 26% similar to that obtained with the other methods for failure analysis.
Relationship of quantal parameters to uEPSC peak amplitudeThe distributions of the three quantal analysis parameters (number of release sites - N, quantal size - Q and the binomial probability of neurotransmitter release - p) are shown as histograms in Figure 6A-C. The average number of release sites estimated by quantal analysis was 4.29 ± 2.66 (n = 75), with the majority (59/75, or 79%) of connections in the range of 1 to 5 release sites, as has been described previously (Feldmeyer et al., 1999; Feldmeyer et al., 2002; Silver, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004). The average quantal size as estimated from the 59 pairs best described by the binomial or quantal model (Fig. 6B) was 5.02 ± 1.52 pA. The average binomial probability of release (n = 29; Fig. 6C) was only 0.41 ± 0.13, suggesting that, despite the reliability of L4-L4 connections (see 3E), individual release sites only respond to about 2 in 5 action potentials. These quantal parameters were related to the strength of synaptic connections. Greater connection strength was positively correlated with the number of modeled release sites from quantal analysis (orange points in Fig. 6D; R2 = 0.65; p < 0.01), and probability of release (R2 = 0.46; p < 0.01 – Fig. 6F), but not to quantal size (Fig. 6E). We considered pairs with failure rates = 0% to be subject to additional errors in quantal size (since our quantal analysis method relies on the existence of a failure peak) and therefore they were discarded from the correlations shown in Fig. 6E. Similarly, we observed a positive correlation between synaptic strength and the number of putative synaptic contacts as determined by anatomical reconstruction of biocytin-filled pairs (gray points in Fig. 6D; R2 = 0.87; p < 0.01). Only in one case were we able to perform an anatomical reconstruction of a strong connection with perfect reliability of transmission (failure rate = 0.0%). Unlike in the case of weaker pairs, this one connection was mediated by numerous putative synaptic contacts (n = 16; see Supplementary Fig. S4).
Paired pulse responsesShort-term plasticity characteristics have been suggested to be under presynaptic control (Thomson, 2000; Oertner et al., 2002; Schneggenburger et al., 2002). L4-L4 connections in visual cortex behave similarly, with PPF predominating at connections with release probability below 75% and PPD at more reliable connections (R2 = 0.50; p < 0.01; Fig. 6G; PPR ratios for two cells with failure rate > 95% have been excluded from the fit). Short-term plasticity is also correlated with the binomial probability of individual release sites as estimated by quantal analysis (R2=0.41; p<0.01; Fig. 6H) suggesting that the binomial release probability and the overall release probability should correlate, as is the case (R2 = 0.59; p <0.01 Fig. 6I).
Assay of potential contribution of common cellular elements to synaptic functionSynaptic connectivity within local neocortical networks is not random (Song et al., 2005; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005; Yoshimura et al., 2005). Thus, it is of interest to know to what degree common anatomical elements within such microcircuits (e.g. a common presynaptic neuron that diverges to innervate multiple postsynaptic targets or a common postsynaptic neuron that is innervated by multiple presynaptic elements) share functional synaptic properties. Moreover, such an analysis can be used to evaluate the potential contribution of a cortical postsynaptic target to the expression of presynaptic properties and vice-versa. In order to address these questions, we performed triple recordings within L4 from a common presynaptic cell to two postsynaptic cells (simultaneous, n = 7, and sequential, n = 2, recordings) and from a common postsynaptic cell with two presynaptic cells (sequential recordings only; n = 7). Indices of pre- and postsynaptic function, including strength, potency and failure rate, were measured for each set of convergent and divergent connections and compared to similar results from randomly selected sets of connected L4-L4 cell pairs.
Divergent triplets recorded simultaneouslyIn a subset (n = 7/9) of divergent triplets, both connections were recorded simultaneously, permitting individual trial-by-trial analysis of the responses evoked in two postsynaptic cells by activation of a single presynaptic cell. One example of a simultaneously recorded divergent triplet is shown in Figure 7A. Figure 7B shows example traces of one such experiment where the simultaneous responses of the two postsynaptic cells to each action potential elicited in the presynaptic cell are illustrated. The time plots of the uEPSC peak amplitudes in response to the first of the two spikes elicited in the presynaptic cell for each connection are shown in Figures 7C and 7D with the superimposed averaged responses to both presynaptic spikes shown as an inset. Note that cell A (top green traces in Fig. 7B and time plot on Fig. 7C) showed paired pulse facilitation while cell B (bottom blue traces in Fig. 7B and time plot in Fig. 7D) showed paired pulse depression. In order to determine whether the responses at the two sets of connections were functionally linked we plotted the peak uEPSC amplitude of one connection vs. the other on a trial by trial basis. Figure 7E shows this analysis for the set of connections illustrated in Fig 7A-C - no correlation was found between the trial-by-trial peak amplitude for either cell (Fig. 7G, R2 = 0, p = 0.33). Similarly, no such correlation was found for any of the 7 simultaneously recorded divergent triplets (average R2 = 0.009, all p values > 0.05, n = 7). We also analyzed the proportion of simultaneous synaptic events (Fig. 7H) in each connection in the simultaneously recorded divergent triplets p(raUrb) and compared it to what would be predicted if the two connections behaved independently. If this was the case, the rate of simultaneous failures would be the product of the independently estimated success rate p(r) for each connection p(r)ap(r)b. If presynaptic terminals that belong to the same presynaptic cell tend to release neurotransmitter simultaneously, a deviation from this estimation should occur consistently across experiments. We were able to calculate these expected values for 5 simultaneously recorded divergent triplets. The other two included one pair with a failure rate = 0, prohibiting extracting a meaningful value with this analysis. The expected and observed proportions of simultaneous releases and failures were not significantly different (p=0.86, Student's t-test), suggesting that individual presynaptic terminals in different parts of the axonal tree behave independently (Fig. 7I). Figure 7H shows the strength, potency and failure rate for each triplet where a divergent connection from a common presynaptic cell drives two separate postsynaptic cells, arranged from the pair of connections that are the most similar in strength to the left (triplet number 1; strengtha = 4.08 pA, strengthb = 4.80 pA, normalized difference in strength=0.08) to the one with the greatest absolute difference in strength to the right (triplet number 7; strengtha = 9.32 pA, strengthb = 53.17 pA, normalized difference in strength = 0.7). There were considerable differences in strength, potency and failure rate with the maximal differences being 43.85 pA, 43.11 pA and 43.8%, respectively (average differences were 13.67 ± 14.61 pA, 12.89 ± 13.98 pA and 20.5 ± 14; 89%, respectively).To determine whether the connections in a divergent triplet set were more similar between them than expected from random sampling of all L4-L4 functionally connected cell pairs, we performed multiple comparisons between the differences in strength, potency and failure rate for the divergent triplet database (n = 9) with 100 similarly sized (n = 9) sets of pairs of uEPSC and failure rate values obtained from randomly sampling our entire database of L4-L4 connection parameters (see Materials and Methods). One hundred of these randomly generated normailized difference values are shown for comparison in Figure 7I as black (p > 0.05) or red (p < 0.05) points. In all three cases, only a small minority of comparisons (< 5%) showed a significant difference between observed and simulated values. Thus, neither overall connection strength, potency nor failure rate are more similar between pairs that share a common presynaptic cell.
Potential contribution of a common cellular postsynaptic target to synaptic propertiesIn some experiments (n = 7), we obtained paired recordings from two connections impinging onto a common postsynaptic cell. The anatomical reconstructions of these three neurons and the individual time plots of the peak amplitudes of each pairs evoked uEPSCs are shown in Figure 8A-C. Unlike in the cases of recorded divergent triplets (Fig. 7) the data for the two pairs in the convergent triplet were obtained sequentially ruling out trial-by-trial analysis of the two uEPSCs. Figure 8D shows the relationship between the strength, potency and failure rate for pairs of connections, similar to Figure 7I but in this case for different inputs to a common postsynaptic cell. As for the divergent triplets, the histogram is arranged from the pair of connections with the most similar strength values on the left (triplet number 1; strengtha = 2.74 pA, strengthb = 2.93 pA; normalized strength difference = 0.03) to the one with the greatest absolute difference in strength on the right (triplet number 7; strengtha = 10.26 pA, strengthb = 83.79 pA; normalized strength difference = 0.78). The maximum observed differences in strength, potency and failure rate were 72.43 pA, 73.43 pA and 20%, respectively. The average differences in strength, potency and failure rate across all convergent triplets (n = 7) were 23.71 ± 24.61 pA, 23.59 ± 24.22 pA and 13.01 ± 0.06%, respectively. The average values were not significantly different from those obtained for divergent triplets (p > 0.05, Student's t-test). We compared the difference in strength, potency and failure rate for the connections in convergent triplets with similarly sized (Fig. 8E; n = 7) sets of differences obtained from randomly sampled L4-L4 connection parameters (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 7I). We conclude that as was the case for divergent triplets, convergent triplets do not behave more similarly than expected from random sampling of pairs of L4-L4 connections.
L4 outputs to L2/3 and L1 cellsAlthough the primary focus of this study is the intralaminar excitatory unitary synaptic connections between pairs of L4 neurons in the visual cortex, we were also interested in the output properties of L4 neurons onto other postsynaptic interlaminar targets. Thus, in several cases, we recorded from pairs of presynaptic L4 neurons and postsynaptic neurons located in other layers, including layer 2/3 and layer 1. We tested 289 connections between putative L4 presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic cells located in supragranular layers. Of these, we successfully recorded from six L4-L2/3 connected cell pairs and one L4-L1 cell pair. A photomicrograph and anatomical reconstruction of the L4-L1 connection are shown in Figure 9 A-B. That L4-L1 connection was very weak (strength = 0.85 pA; potency = 4.44 pA; failure rate = 74%) and underwent prominent paired-pulse facilitation (PPR = 4.13). Example traces, the averaged evoked response to both presynaptic spikes and the time plot of the peak PSC amplitudes are shown in Figures 9C and 9D, respectively. A photomicrograph and reconstruction of a L4-L2/3 connected cell pair, along with similar recordings are shown in Figure 9E-G. This connection had a moderate strength of 3.88 pA, a potency of 7.99 pA and a failure rate of 29%. Strengths of L4-L2/3 connections ranged from 2.53 to 60.03 pA (mean = 15.63 ± 22.36 pA), and their failure rates ranged from 0 to 77% (mean = 36 ± 30%). The individual traces, averaged responses and presynaptic spikes are shown in Figure 9G and the time plot in Figure 9H. These values are not significantly different from those of L4-L4 connections (p = 0.65 and p = 0.51, respectively, Wilcoxon test). Despite the limited sample size for these interlaminar connections, the relationship between their strength and failure rate is similar to that for L4-L2/3 connections. Figure 9I shows the strength/failure rate values for the L4-L2/3 pairs (black points) as well as the L4-L1 pair (red point) in relations to the similar plots for the larger sample of L4-L4 pairs (light grey points).
DISCUSSION
SummaryL4-L4 excitatory synaptic connections are variable in strength, failure rate, and short-term plasticity behavior. These properties are interrelated - reliable connections (failure rates <30%, n=57/89; 64%) are strong (average potency = 34.07±36.61 pA) and undergo paired-pulse depression (average PPR = 0.73±0.19) whereas unreliable connections (failure rates >30%, n=32/89; 36%) are weak (average potency = 8.17±6.19 pA) and undergo paired-pulse potentiation (average PPR=3.01±6.61). Synaptic properties of multiple cells with a common pre- or postsynaptic element are independent, indicative of local influences that are perhaps developmentally regulated (Lohmann et al., 2002; Pelkey and McBain, 2008) or dependent on experience and local synaptic history (Abraham and Bear, 1996; Le Be and Markram, 2006).
Range of functional propertiesAverage uEPSC strength and potency ranged from 0.42 to 192.93 pA, and from 3.03 to 192.93 pA, respectively with 97% of both measures <100 pA. Failure rates ranged from 0% to 100% (the 100% failure rate connection only responded to a second paired pulse spike). Interestingly, among perfectly reliable connections (0% failure rates; n=21/89), the average strength (and potency) was large, ranging from 14.24 pA to 192.93 pA with a median of 56.19 pA. Also, connections with no failures generally had large potencies (14.24 to 192.93 pA; median = 56.19 pA; Fig. 3E), whereas connections that exhibited failures had small potencies (range = 3.03 to 60.11 pA; median = 7.60 pA; p<0.01, Wilcoxon test). This did not necessarily have to be the case, as neurotransmitter release probability and potency may not be inter-dependent (Stevens and Wang, 1994). Paired-pulse responses were largely determined by presynaptic reliability (see Fig. 6G). Similar to other synapses (Mennerick and Zorumski, 1995; Hashimoto and Kano, 1998; Oleskevich et al., 2000), unreliable connections exhibited paired-pulse facilitation, whereas reliable connections exhibited paired-pulse depression.
Quantal analysisWe used unbiased quantal analysis (Stricker and Redman, 2003; Cowan and Stricker, 2004), making no a priori assumptions about the behavior of individual release sites. The binomial model assumes that release probabilities across sites are uniform and independent (Kullmann, 1989; Clements, 2003). Although most connections (59/75; 79%) were quantal, only a minority (29/75, or 39%) were best described by a binomial model. Thus, probabilities across release sites may not always be uniform, perhaps due to differences in presynaptic densities or readily releasable pools (Harris and Sultan, 1995), vesicle fusion machinery (Augustin et al., 1999; Rosenmund et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002), or activity histories.Our anatomical (n=9) and quantal analysis (n=75) estimates for the average number of release sites agree with each other (4.11±4.56 and 4.29±2.02, respectively) and are close to previous estimates for L4 connections to other L4 (6.6±2.1 – Cowan and Stricker, 2004; 3.4±1.0 - Feldmeyer et al., 1999) and to L2/3 (4.5±0.5 - Feldmeyer et al., 2002; 5.1±0.9 - Silver et al., 2003) cells, although our results suggest that the range of N might be greater than previously thought (Fig. 5D). The average individual site release probability for binomial pairs (p) was 41.3±13.4%, suggesting that individual release sites respond, on average, to about 2 of 5 spikes and that reliability is primarily due to factors such as the number of release sites (Fig. 5D). This is in contrast with previous estimates of release probabilities at individual L4-L4 sites (rat S1, average Pr=79±2% – Silver et al., 2003; cat V1 range of Pr=68−98% - Tarczy-Hornoch et al., 1999). However, in these studies, a binomial release model was assumed and weak unreliable connections were not found. Alternatively, the difference may be due to age or species.
Contribution of common pre- or postsynaptic cellsBy recording from triplets of connected cells, we evaluated the potential contribution of common pre- and postsynaptic cellular elements (Figs.7 and 8). We found no evidence for common functional properties among such cellular triads (Figs. 7I and 8E), suggesting that synaptic reliability and potency at connections with a common cellular element are likely to be under local peri-synaptic regulation. Although there may be some functional relationship among synapses with common cellular elements during development, these similarities may become obscured due to local plasticity differences (Bramham, 2008; Turrigiano, 2008) such as the recent history of an individual synapse or dendritic segment (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1997).
Morphology of excitatory L4 cellsMost (116/118) V1 L4 excitatory neurons in guinea pig cortex were pyramidal in contrast with the abundance of spiny stellate cells reported in cat (Anderson et al., 1994; Stratford et al., 1996; Tarczy-Hornoch et al., 1999) and macaque V1 (Lund et al., 1979; Saint Marie and Peters, 1985; Yabuta et al., 2001) and in rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 1999; Schubert et al., 2003; Feldmeyer et al., 2005). Possible explanations include: denser interconnections between pyramidal cells, whole cell recording selection bias, delayed development of spiny stellates (Vercelli et al., 1992) or species/cortical area differences (McCormick et al., 1985). The difference in connectivity would have to be several orders of magnitude greater than in rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 1999; Cowan and Stricker, 2004) and cat V1 (Tarczy-Hornoch et al., 1999; Binzegger et al., 2004) to account for our low proportion (<2%) of spiny stellates. When neurons without an apparent apical dendrite were patched, they had properties consistent with inhibitory interneurons, including high Rin and little spike frequency adaptation (Connors and Gutnick, 1990). It is unlikely that late development of spiny stellates was a factor because we used guinea pigs (which are more precocious than other rodents - Rice et al., 1985) in their second postnatal week, when spiny stellates are abundant within L4 in other preparations such as rat S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 1999; Schubert et al., 2003; Feldmeyer et al., 2005). Since the morphology was largely similar (pyramidal) for most cells in our study, we were unable to relate functional properties to morphological cell type.Analyses of uEPSP rise time can indicate relative distance of synaptic inputs from the recording site (Redman, 1990; Magee and Cook, 2000; Williams and Stuart, 2003; Letzkus et al., 2006). However, under voltage clamp, limited effective space clamp restricts the accuracy of similar analysis of uEPSCs (Wiliams and Mitchell, 2008). All the putative anatomical synaptic contacts that we observed were located on proximal basilar dendrites (distance range = 33−151 μm from the soma; n=9 connected pairs). Such putative contacts are often anatomically verifiable synapses (93% - Silver et al., 2003; 86% - Lubke et al., 2003) although other studies suggest the proportion may be much smaller (32%; DaCosta and Martin, 2007). Due to the narrow range of synaptic distances and to the limitations of effective space clamp, we were unable to reliably infer the location of synapses from the uEPSC characteristics, alone.
Functional implicationsOur results indicate that L4 neuron synapses have more heterogeneous failure rates than previously reported for L4 inputs to L4 (Feldmeyer et al., 1999) or to L2/3 neurons (Feldmeyer et al., 2002; Silver et al., 2003). Assuming a postsynaptic Rin of 100MΩ, Em of −70mV and threshold of −40mV, a Monte Carlo sampling of L4-L4 connection strengths indicates that on average, simultaneous activation of 15.7±5.7 presynaptic L4 cells could elicit postsynaptic spiking, assuming linear input summation. In cat V1, if the distribution of inputs onto pyramidal cells is similar to that onto spiny stellates, then they would receive ∼3,000 excitatory inputs onto spines (11%, 44%, 24% and 21% from thalamocortical, L4, L6 and unknown sources, respectively; Ahmed et al., 1994). In rat barrel cortex (Lubke et al., 20000; Bruno and Sakmann, 2006), L4 neurons have ∼2,800 dendritic spines and a similar distribution of excitatory innervation (21%, 45% and 34% maximum for thalamocortical, L4 and L6 inputs, respectively). Excitatory L4 neurons in guinea pig V1 have ∼2500 spines (see Results). Based on these anatomical data and our estimate of the number of release sites mediating individual L4-L4 pyramidal cell connections derived from quantal analysis (4.29±2.65, Fig.6A), if the relative fraction of inputs to spines are similar to cat V1 or rat S1 (∼45%) and if few of these synapses are on dendritic shafts (∼25%; Ahmed et al., 1994), the average L4 to L4 neuron convergence ratio would be ∼350:1. About 125 (36%) of these connections would be expected to show relatively high failure rates (>30%). Although weak, if these connections were to fire nearly synchronously they could drive L4 postsynaptic cells to spike in vivo. For example, highly synchronized thalamocortical inputs, which are considerably less numerous than L4-L4 connections (see above) are efficient drivers of L4 in vivo despite being in a continuously depressed state due to the continuous barrage of synaptic input (Bruno and Sakmann, 2006). Interestingly, unreliable L4/L4 connections undergo PPF in vitro (average PPR>3, Fig. 6G), suggesting that they operate in a continuously facilitated state, multiplying their contribution to postsynaptic depolarization. Alternatively, activation of this set of weak connections could contribute to ongoing subthreshold synaptic activity, which has been shown to be important for modulating gain of cortical neurons (Chance et al., 2002), cortical processing of attention (Salinas and Abbott, 1997; Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004), integration of eye movement commands into visual processing (Moore and Armstrong, 2003), and light adaptation (Ohzawa et al., 1982).
