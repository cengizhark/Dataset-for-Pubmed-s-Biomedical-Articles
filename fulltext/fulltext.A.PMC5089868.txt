1. Introduction
Malaria remains a global health crisis and it has been argued that eradication of the disease cannot be achieved without the development of efficacious vaccines against Plasmodium parasites [1]. Although there are several subunit and vectored anti-malarial vaccines under clinical evaluation [2], current experimental vaccines that elicit the most potent and long-lasting protection in humans are those formulated using live attenuated sporozoites incapable of causing disease [3–6]. Radiation- and genetically-attenuated parasites, and the prophylactic use of anti-malarial drugs targeting blood stage parasites, are promising strategies currently under evaluation in clinical trials as pre-erythrocytic vaccine platforms [7–10]. Notably, each of these leading pre-erythrocytic vaccine platforms was first predicted and qualified using rodent models [11–13]. Thus, experimental mouse models continue to provide fundamentally important information regarding the mechanisms of immune resistance induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination.
Studies in rodents have conclusively shown that a central component of protective pre-erythrocytic vaccination involves the induction of parasite-specific CD8 T cells targeting Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes [11,14,15]. Data in humans also show strong correlations between the activity of CD8 T cells and protection against experimental mosquito bite challenge [5,6,10,16]. CD8 T cells limit parasite survival by several pathways, including direct cytolysis of infected hepatocytes, and by expressing anti-parasitic cytokines that act to limit parasite survival within infected hepatocytes [14,17–19]. Although data supporting a role for CD4 T cells in limiting liver stage infections is less abundant, several studies demonstrate that CD4+ major histocompatibility (MHC) class II-restricted T cells can exert cytolytic activity against parasite-infected cells [20–23]. Moreover, MHC class I deficient mice, which lack CD8 T cells, are resistant to sporozoite challenge following multiple vaccinations with attenuated Plasmodium sporozoites [24]. Protection in the latter studies depended on CD4 T cells and correlated with neutralizing parasite-specific antibody responses. Finally, CD4 T cells also are important regulators of CD8 T cell responses, as Plasmodium-specific CD8 T cells fail to form sizable memory populations in the absence of CD4 T cells [25]. Thus, parasite-specific CD4 T cells are also important regulators of vaccine-induced anti-Plasmodium immunity via their provision of help for CD8 T cells and B cells, and perhaps through direct cytolysis of parasite-infected cells [20–22]. Collectively, these studies underscore the critical role for T cells in mediating pre-erythrocytic vaccine-induced protection against Plasmodium. Therefore, defining the numerical, phenotypic and functional features of parasite-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells activated by pre-erythrocytic vaccination remains an important goal.
High-resolution study of pathogen-specific T cells classically requires knowledge of defined T cell epitopes and MHC restriction elements, or access to immunologic tools such as MHC tetramers or T cell receptor transgenic (TCR Tg) mice. For both Plasmodium yoelii and P. berghei liver stage parasites several tools exist and at least one dominant CD8 T cell epitope from each parasite has been mapped in inbred BALB/c mice [26]. These CD8 T cell epitopes derive from the sporozoite- and liver stage-expressed circumsporozoite (CS) protein (P. yoelii, amino acids 280–288, CS280–288; P. berghei, CS252–260, e.g. Fig. 1) [26]. Notably, TCR Tg mice have been generated for the P. yoelii CD8 T cell determinant [27]. Plasmodium-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells have also been generated, but the MHC class II-restricted TCR is specific for a blood stage antigen (MSP-1) and the epitope is only expressed by P. chabaudi rodent parasites [28–30]. More recently, Heath and colleagues developed a new TCR Tg mouse line bearing CD8 T cells responsive to an antigen expressed during both blood and liver stage [31]. Strikingly, the epitope from this antigen is conserved in P. berghei, P. yoelii and P. chabaudi, so future applications of this new research tool should reveal important information about cross-stage (blood and liver) specific CD8 T cell immunity. Because the experimental use of TCR Tg CD8 T cells in malaria models was recently reviewed [32], specific protocols are not described herein.
It is well known that CS-specific CD8 T cell populations can be sufficient to limit or stop the progression of liver stage Plasmodium parasites [17,26,27,33,34]. Thus, there are clear advantages to studying CS-specific endogenous (polyclonal) or TCR Tg (monoclonal) CD8 T cells. On the other hand, as noted above, CD4 T cells also contribute to resistance and several studies have shown that non-CS-specific CD8 T cells significantly limit Plasmodium liver stage infection [35,36]. Indeed, more than 80% of CD8 T cells induced by radiation attenuated sporozoite (RAS) vaccination of BALB/c mice are responding to nonCS antigens [15] (Fig. 1), so studying the biology and behavior of these cells is equally important. However, the lack of additional and validated non-CS-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes has hampered direct study of these T cell populations of unknown antigenic specificity. To overcome these limitations, cell surface markers of T cell activation have been widely used to monitor Plasmodium vaccination-induced T cell responses. For example, modulation of CD62L, CD44, CD122, and CD45RB expression has been used to identify RAS-induced, liver-resident CD8 T cells [37–40]. However, several of these molecules are expressed on both naïve and memory T cells (e.g. CD62L and CD122, [41]) or they exhibit a continuum of expression (e.g. expression of CD44 is not bimodal). Moreover, the expression of several of these markers can be modulated by T cell homeostatic proliferation [42]. These variables add to the difficulty of distinguishing among bona fide naïve, effector and memory T cells through monitoring CD62L, CD44 and CD122.
In an effort to further enhance resolution and more clearly distinguish true naïve and effector and memory T cells, we developed alternative methods to track T cell responses following Plasmodium infection or vaccination in both inbred and outbred mice [15,43]. Notably, these methods were first validated using models of virus and bacterial infection [44,45]. We determined that antigen activated CD8 T cells could be distinguished from naïve CD8 T cells based on the coordinate upregulation of the integrin CD11a (the alpha L chain of LFA-1) and downregulation of the CD8α chain of the co-receptor. Effector and memory CD8 T cells are CD11ahiCD8αlo and naïve CD8 T cells are CD11aloCD8αhi (Fig. 2). Unlike CD8 T cells, antigen activated CD4 T cells do not appreciably downregulate the CD4 co-receptor, so monitoring the coordinate upregulation of CD11a and an additional integrin, CD49d (the alpha 4 chain of VLA-4), is used to distinguish naïve CD4 T cells from antigen-activated CD4 T cells [43,45]. Effector and memory CD4 T cells are CD11ahiCD49dhi and naïve CD4 T cells are CD11aloCD49dlo (Fig. 2). There are three main advantages to using these approaches: (1) modulation of CD8α, CD11a and CD49d requires TCR cross-linking and does not occur following exposure of T cells to inflammation or homeostatic proliferation [43–45]. Thus, examination of CD11a, CD8α, and CD49d T cell phenotypes faithfully and durably identifies infection- or vaccination induced, pathogen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. (2) endogenous T cell responses can be studied without knowledge of specific Plasmodium antigens/epitopes or MHC class I or MHC class II restriction elements; and (3) any combination of inbred or outbred mouse strains and Plasmodium parasite species can be studied. Overall, these approaches allow for direct examination of the magnitude, kinetics, distribution, phenotype, and function of T cell responses to Plasmodium infection or pre-erythrocytic vaccination. These approaches also allow for longitudinal analyses of T cell responses through analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and thus permit characterization of T cell responses in individual mice over time prior to parasite challenge studies.
The methods detailed below allow researchers to directly identify and interrogate CD4 and CD8 T cell populations induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination and recovered from multiple tissues from the vaccinated host. Of note, methods for immunizing rodents with live attenuated Plasmodium parasite vaccine platforms have been previously covered [46,47], so our chapter will only describe methods for examining T cell responses induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccination. Such studies will continue to provide fundamentally important insight into the factors that determine the potent sterilizing immunity induced by pre-erythrocytic vaccines. This information can potentially guide improvement of current pre-erythrocytic vaccines as well as enhance the development of subunit vaccines that elicit similar populations of T cells. Defining the specific numerical and functional properties of T cells that determine protection will increase the likelihood of developing readily deployable vaccines in regions of the world where anti-malarial vaccines are needed most.

3.2 AnalysisThis section describes the collection and analysis of flow cytometric data to determine the frequency of antigen-experienced effector and memory CD8 and CD4 T cells following pre-erythrocytic vaccination. This protocol does not describe how to properly compensate samples on a flow cytometer (see Note 13).Using an analytical flow cytometer program, draw a population gate around viable lymphocytes using forward-area (FSC-A) and side-area (SSC-A) scatter parameters (X- and Y-axis, respectively). This population gate excludes cell debris (or small, likely dead cells) from further analysis.Optional—If the flow cytometer is capable of analyzing forward width scatter (FSC-W), draw a population gate around single cell (‘singlet’) lymphocyte populations using forward width (FSC-W) and side-area scatter (SSC-A); this gate excludes cell doublets from further analysis.Draw a population gate on lymphocytes that are negative for staining with viability dye reagents. This gate further excludes dead cells and enhances the quality and resolution of data for downstream analyses of T cell phenotype and function.For CD8 T cell analyses, draw a population gate around CD8+CD90+ cells by viewing CD8α staining on the X-axis, and CD90.2 staining on the Y-axis. Next gate on the antigen-experienced (CD8αloCD11ahi) CD8 T cells by examining CD8α expression and CD11a expression on the X- and Y-axis, respectively.Optional—the fraction of CD8αloCD11ahi CD8 T cells that are CS-specific can be determined by examining the fraction of antigen-experienced CD8 T cells that bind the MHC class I tetramer by viewing CD8α on the X-axis and tetramer on the Y-axis (Figs. 1 and 2).For CD4 T cell analyses, draw a population gate around CD4+CD90+ cells by viewing CD4 staining on the X-axis, and CD90.2 staining on the Y-axis. Next gate on the antigen-experienced (CD11ahiCD49dhi) CD4 T cells by examining CD11a expression and CD49d expression on the X- and Y-axis, respectively (Fig. 2).Additional parameters of T cell phenotype and function and be analyzed by including additional reagents in the cell staining cocktails, assuming the analytical flow cytometer can accommodate the extra channels required (i.e. appropriate lasers and filter sets).
