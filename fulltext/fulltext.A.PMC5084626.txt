Procedure
Start 5 ml overnight culture of E. coli isolate UTI89 (Note 1) in LB at 37 °C with aeration. Culture can be started from a colony on an agar plate or from a −80 °C glycerol stock.Setting up the phase-PCR reaction
Phase PCR was performed using a 1:1:1 mixture of 3 phase primers including 1) an anchor primer outside of the invertible region (primer 1); 2) a phase-specific primer for the OFF orientation (primer 2); and 3) a phase-specific primer for the ON orientation (primer 3).
Reaction mixture (Note 2)1 µl overnight bacterial culture (template)2.5 µl of 10× APEX NH4 buffer (1× final concentration)0.5 µl of 1 unit/µl APEX Taq polymerase (0.5 unit final concentration)1.25 µl of 50 mM MgCl2 (2.5 mM final concentration)0.1 µl of 100 µM stock of each of 3 primers (0.4 µM final concentration of each primer)0.5 µl of 10 mM dNTP mix (0.2 mM final concentration)up to 25 µl total volume with sterile diH2O.Thermal cycler program:
94°C for 3 min× 1 cycle94°C for 30 sec×30 cycles54°C for 30 sec72°C for 25 sec72°C for 6 min× 1 cycleHold at 4°CMake 50 ml volume of 2% agarose in 1× TBE (see below). Pour gel into casting apparatus.Cover gel completely with 1× TBE (running buffer).Mix 5–10 µl of PCR reaction with 0.5–1.0 µl 10× DNA loading dye (approx. 1× final concentration). Load into wells and run samples at 100–120 V for 45 min to 1 h.Visualize and photograph using a UV gel transilluminator.Mixed phase populations show two bands by PCR, corresponding to the OFF and ON promoter orientations. The OFF orientation gives a 196 bp amplicon vs. a 231 bp amplicon for the ON orientation.
