Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders with a prominent erythroid dysplasia of the bone marrow (BM) responsible for a macrocytic anemia. Mitochondrial iron accumulation and apoptosis of mature erythroblasts cause ineffective erythropoiesis (1, 2). In contrast to other MDS subtypes, patients with MDS-RS exhibit signs of systemic iron accumulation that is reflected by increased ferritin and non-transferrin bound iron concentrations even before they become transfusion-dependent and subsequently develop parenchymal iron overload (3, 4).
Splicing factor gene SF3B1 is mutated in ~90% of MDS-RS, and the diagnosis is considered whenever the gene is mutated, even if the percentage of RS is relatively low, between 5 and 15% (5–7). These mutations arise in the HSCs (8–10). Aberrant splicing events are reported in MDS and other SF3B1-driven cancers, including uveal melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (11–14). The selection of an alternative branch site resulting in the use of a cryptic 3’ splice site (ss) is the most frequently detected abnormality. Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic 3’ss are located upstream of canonical 3’ss at nucleotide distances that are not multiples of 3, suggesting that the aberrant transcripts would likely contain a premature termination codon (PTC) and be degraded by non-sense mediated decay (NMD). It has been predicted that half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1-mutated cells are NMD-sensitive and that the canonical isoforms are down-regulated (11). For instance, ABCB7 transcript encoding a mitochondrial transporter involved in the export of Fe-S clusters is aberrantly spliced and undergoes NMD. It is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into proteins with altered function (11). Globally, mis-splicing may contribute to defective mRNA production and deregulation of cellular pathways (17–18). How these aberrant splicing events contribute to the disease phenotype and in particular to systemic iron overload is unclear.
In contrast with other MDS subtypes, MDS-RS are associated with lower expression of the iron homeostasis regulator, hepcidin, and as a consequence, the absorption of iron by duodenal enterocytes and its release from erythrophagocytic macrophages may be increased (19–24). Inappropriately low hepcidin concentrations in MDS-RS could depend on the degree of ineffective erythropoiesis linked to impaired iron incorporation into heme because of mitochondrial iron trapping and/or to increased expression of hepcidin repressors (25). Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and twisted gastrulation (TWSG1), two members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, have been proposed as pathological suppressors of hepcidin in ineffective erythropoiesis (26, 27). More recently, erythroferrone (ERFE), a C1q–tumor necrosis factor–related family of proteins (CTRP) member, has been described as a major erythroid regulator of hepcidin, involved in the pathological suppression of hepcidin in patients with β-thalassemia (28, 29).
In the present study, we identify a variant transcript of ERFE specific to SF3B1-mutated MDS. The expression of the variant ERFE is restricted to the erythroid lineage, and the variant contributes to increased concentration of ERFE protein, resulting in hepcidin suppression and systemic iron accumulation in patients. This variant appears to be a pertinent biomarker of clonal erythropoiesis with potential use for monitoring treatment response of anemic patients with SF3B1-mutated MDS.
Results
Upregulation of ERFE using an alternative 3’ splice site in SF3B1-mutated MDSTo investigate the mechanism of systemic iron overload, we established a cohort of 156 patients with lower risk MDS, including 60 MDS-RS with single lineage dysplasia (SLD), 17 MDS-RS with multilineage dysplasia (MLD), 2 5q-syndrome, 17 MDS-SLD, 42 MDS-MLD, and 18 MDS with type 1 excess of blasts (EB1) (table S1). The Revised-International Prognosis Scoring System score was very low in 15, low in 95, intermediate in 36, and high in 4 patients. Twenty-six genes commonly mutated in MDS were sequenced in the BM mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction. SF3B1 gene was mutated in 94 patients with MDS, including 63 (67%) affected by a SF3B1K700E mutation. Among the 62 patients with no SF3B1 mutation, other splicing genes, SRSF2, U2AF1, or ZRSR2 were mutated in 27 cases, and no splicing gene mutation was observed in 35 cases. Some patients presented with two splicing mutations (fig. S1). We evaluated the consequences of SF3B1 gene mutations on gene expression and splicing by sequencing the transcriptome of the BM MNCs isolated from 27 patients in this cohort, including 21 with SF3B1MUT MDS, 6 with SF3B1WT MDS, and 5 healthy controls. Differential analyses of gene expression and splice junctions were conducted using DESeq2 (30). We detected 6,343 genes as differentially expressed between SF3B1MUT MDS and SF3B1WT MDS with a P-value<0.05 (data file S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) of gene expression profiles separated SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT MDS (Fig. 1A). The differentially expressed genes were enriched in 73 specific GO terms with an absolute log2 fold-change (FC)>1 and a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted P-value<0.05 (Fig. 1B). Genes with a log2(FC)< −1 were involved in serine/threonine kinase signaling, apoptosis, myeloid differentiation, inflammation, and cell-cell adhesion, whereas those with a log2(FC)>1 were involved in heme metabolism, erythrocyte differentiation, and iron homeostasis (Fig. 1C). We plotted the log2(FC) of 16 differentially expressed genes belonging to the IRON_ION_HOMEOSTASIS gene set (GO:0055072; http://amigo.geneontology.org) and showed that the FAM132B/ERFE transcript encoding erythroferrone was increased (Fig. 1D). The FAM132B/ERFE transcript was similarly expressed in samples with an epigenetic TET2MUT/DNMT3AWT/SF3B1WT genotype compared to healthy controls or with a DNMT3AMUT/TET2WT/SF3B1MUT compared to DNMT3AWT/TET2WT/ SF3B1MUT genotype, suggesting that the deregulation of ERFE transcript expression was linked to SF3B1 mutation (table S2).We then identified 1,528 differentially expressed 5’ and 3’ junctions, including annotated 5’ donor and 3’ acceptor ss, ambiguous junctions, and canonical junctions with BH-adjusted P-values ≤10−5 and absolute log2(FC) ≥1 (data file S2). These junctions allowed the hierarchical clustering of the 21 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT MDS samples (Fig. 2A). After excluding differentially expressed canonical junctions, we then considered the 1,147 alternative junctions, among which we identified 786 3’ acceptor junctions (68.5%), 176 5’ donor junctions (15.3%), and 185 ambiguous junctions (16.1%) attributed to either the alternative 5’ or 3’ss or both alternative 5’ and 3’ss (Fig. 2B). The analysis of distances between the alternative and canonical 3’ss showed that the majority of alternative 3’ss (AG’) was located between −24 and −9 nucleotides preceding the canonical 3’ss (AG) (Fig. 2C). The proportion of alternative AG’ junctions in these novel splice variants was generally increased in SF3B1 mutants and less frequently in SF3B1WT samples (Fig. 2D). To detect alternative transcripts that were likely to generate substantial amounts of variant proteins with a modified length, we applied a filter selecting transcripts with an additional stretch of nucleotides numbering in multiples of 3, a ratio of alternative junction coverage (AG’) to alternative and canonical junctions coverage (AG’+AG) over 0.1, and an expression ratio of the alternative junction in SF3B1MUT versus SF3B1WT samples over 10 (fig. S2A). We obtained 66 alternative junctions in 63 genes (data file S3 & fig. S2B). These genes were involved in the epigenetic regulation and transcription, mRNA processing and translation, intracellular transport, cell cycle and migration, signaling and apoptosis, mitochondrial metabolism, and iron homeostasis (Fig. 2E). Among the 66 alternative junctions, 29 were related to an in-frame insertion of 9 to 27 nucleotides, and 26 of them were differentially expressed between SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT MDS with an absolute log2(FC) >0.3 (Fig. 2F). FAM132B/ERFE gene was identified among the upregulated genes with an alternative junction due to the use of a cryptic 3’ss located between exons 2 and 3 (chr2: 239,070,357 – 239,071,364) and no PTC. The aberrant transcript contained 12 additional nucleotides in the open reading frame and from here on is referred to as ERFE+12 (Fig. 2G). It was systematically detected in all SF3B1MUT MDS samples and represented a mean percentage of 24.8% of FAM132B/ERFE transcripts in SF3B1MUT MDS versus 0.2% in SF3B1WT MDS. The mutation pattern of samples expressing ERFE+12 is shown in fig. S2C. This indicates that the expression of ERFE+12 was strongly linked to the presence of a mutation in SF3B1 gene.
SF3B1MUT-restricted expression of alternative ERFE+12 transcriptTo ascertain that expression of the ERFE+12 transcript is dependent on the presence of a SF3B1 mutation, we transfected the erythro-megakaryocytic cell line UT7/EPO with a pLVX plasmid encoding a synthetic full-length SF3B1WT or mutant SF3B1K700E cDNA. We then designed a sensitive fluorescent PCR allowing the detection of ERFE+12 and ERFEWT transcripts as 162 nucleotides (nt) and 150 nt fragments by capillary electrophoresis (table S3). Twenty-four hours after transfection, ERFE+12 transcript was detected in SF3B1K700E transfected cells, but not in SF3B1WT cells (Fig. 3A). To validate the splice pattern induced in the context of SF3B1 mutation in ERFE pre-mRNA, we performed a minigene splicing assay. An ERFE sequence of about 200 nucleotides located on both sides of the cryptic 3’ss (AG’) was cloned in an ExonTrap vector. The alternative junction in ENOSF1 gene (chr18: 683,395–685,920) cloned in the same vector was used as a control (13). These minigenes were transfected into the murine G1E-ER4 cell line in which the SF3B1K700E mutation was edited by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected due to the lack of intron homology between species, sequencing the transcriptome of G1E-ER4 SF3B1K700E cell line or isogenic SF3B1WT cell line demonstrated that endogenous murine ERFE and ENOSF1 did not undergo alternative splicing (12). After transfection, the alternative 3’ss AG’ ERFE+12 was detected by capillary electrophoresis in G1E-ER4 SF3B1K700E cells, but not in the isogenic G1E-ER4 SF3B1WT or parental cells (Fig. 3B). The usage of alternative 3’ss AG’ was detectable for ENOSF1 gene in SF3B1WT cell line and became predominant in SF3B1K700E cell line, suggesting that the mutation favored the usage of alternative AG’. Then, we performed a rescue experiment by adding a destabilization domain (DD)-tag to the mutant SF3B1R625G allele in Mel202 cell line, as described (31). The DD-tagged protein is stabilized by interaction with the DD ligand Shield-1 and is degraded upon Shield-1 withdrawal. In Mel202 clone 26 containing one DD-tagged SF3B1R625G allele, Shield-1 removal abrogated ERFE+12 expression. This supports a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutation and the aberrant splicing isoform of ERFE (fig. S3).We then investigated the expression of ERFEWT and ERFE+12 in primary BM samples of MDS patients using fluorescent PCR and RT-qPCR (table S3). Among 46 lower risk MDS patients, SF3B1MUT was present in 25, including 20 with MDS-SLD-RS/MDS-MLD-RS, 3 with MDS-MLD, and 2 with MDS-EB1. By fluorescent PCR, ERFE+12 was detected in the BM MNC fractions of all SF3B1MUT MDS. ERFE+12 was not detected in any other cases of MDS with mutations in SRSF2 (n=10), U2AF1 (n=1), or ZRSR2 (n=1), or in 9 MDS patients with mutations in other genes, as shown in Fig. 3C and table S4. ERFEWT and ERFE+12 mRNA amounts measured by RT-qPCR were up-regulated in SF3B1MUT samples compared to any SF3B1WT samples with other splicing or epigenetic mutations or without recurrent mutation (Fig. 3D, table S4). In one patient with an SF3B1 monoallelic deletion and a G742D substitution on the remaining allele, the expression of alternative ERFE+12 exceeded that of the canonical ERFEWT (fig. S4). We then amplified primary erythroblasts from the BM CD34+ cells of two patients with SF3B1MUT and one patient with SF3B1WT MDS and showed that ERFE+12 was expressed in SF3B1MUT but not in SF3B1WT erythroid cells (Fig. 3E). This further supports the idea that ERFE+12 is related to SF3B1 mutation. SF3B1MUT MDS are characterized by the enrichment of the BM with erythroid cells. To investigate whether ERFE+12 could be detected in cells derived from erythroblastic BM with another genetic background, we collected samples from one patient with MDS-RS with 38% of BM erythroblasts, more than 15% of RS, a normal karyotype, and no SF3B1 mutation but one SRSF2 and one TET2 mutation, three patients with a congenital sideroblastic anemia due to an ALAS2 mutation/deletion or a GLRX5 mutation, one patient with a severe β-thalassemia, and one patient with SF3B1K700E MDS. By fluorescent PCR, ERFEWT was present, whereas ERFE+12 was not detectable in any sample except the SF3B1K700E MDS (Fig. 3F). This confirms that the onset of an aberrant ERFE+12 is dependent not on the amplification of the erythroid compartment or the presence of RS, but on the presence of a mutant SF3B1.
Translation of ERFE+12 into a variant protein that represses hepcidinHuman ERFE encodes a 354-aminoacid polypeptide. The addition of 12 nucleotides in ERFE mRNA generates an ERFE variant (further referred to as ERFEVPFQ) containing a valine-proline-phenylalanine-glutamine (VPFQ) insertion immediately upstream of the collagen domain (Fig. 4A & fig. S5A). To investigate whether the mutant ERFEVPFQ protein was produced in vivo, we prepared cell lysates of erythroblasts derived in culture from the BM CD34+ cells of patients with SF3B1MUT MDS. Through LC MS/MS protein identification, we obtained several peptide-matching propositions including the ALHELGVYYLPDAEGAFR peptide (fig. S5B) already reported in public databases (www.proteomicsdb.org/), and we identified a cryptic peptide VPFQFGLPGPPGPPGPQGPP GPIIPPEALLK corresponding to the VPFQ insertion at position 108 of ERFE (Fig. 4B). This confirms that the alternative ERFE+12 transcript is translated into ERFEVPFQ in SF3B1MUT erythroblasts.ERFE represses hepcidin in mice and contributes to pathological hepcidin suppression in patients with transfused and non-transfused β-thalassemia (28, 29). Whether ERFEVPFQ also repressed hepcidin was tested. For this purpose, recombinant proteins ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ were produced in HEK293F cells. SDS-PAGE analysis of ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ in reducing and non-reducing conditions demonstrated that the insertion of 4 amino acids does not change the molecular weight of the protein or its multimerization pattern, such that both proteins were predominantly found in high molecular weight forms (>250 kDa) and in a trimeric form of ~200 kDa (Fig. 4C). Then, Hep3B and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated for 16h with purified ERFEVPFQ or ERFEWT. Both proteins similarly caused a 5-fold reduction in the expression of HAMP mRNA encoding hepcidin compared to controls (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that insertion of 4 amino acids upstream of the collagen domain did not affect the bioactivity of the protein.
Prediction of hyperferritinemia by overproduction of erythroferrone in SF3B1MUT MDSWe then measured the plasma concentration of ERFE in the training cohort of 156 patients with MDS and 20 healthy non-blood donor controls using a validated immunoassay (29). We first verified that the ERFE immunoassay was able to detect both ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ. Indeed, human ERFE ELISA detected similar amounts (1 μg/ml) of each recombinant protein in the supernatants of HEK293F cells transiently transfected with ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ expression vectors. This established that both isoforms were detectable by ELISA. The mean concentration of ERFE in SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT MDS was higher than in 20 non-blood donor healthy controls (P<0.0001; Fig. 5A). Among the MDS samples, the ERFE concentration was higher in SF3B1MUT (135.0±72.5 ng/ml) compared to SF3B1WT (62.1±36.7 ng/ml) MDS (P<0.0001; Fig. 5A). High concentrations of circulating ERFE correlated with high expression of ERFE+12 transcript (Pearson test; P<0.0001; fig. S6A). Consistently, the ERFE concentration was also higher in MDS-RS compared to all other WHO MDS subtypes (fig. S6B). Ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in SF3B1MUT patients compared to SF3B1WT patients (P<0.0001; Fig. 5B). We also measured plasma hepcidin and confirmed that the concentration of hepcidin in SF3B1MUT MDS was significantly lower compared to SF3B1WT MDS (P=0.031; Fig. 5C). We found no difference between SF3B1MUT MDS and healthy controls. The hepcidin/ferritin ratio was lower in SF3B1MUT than inSF3B1WT MDS (P<0.0001; Fig. 5D) and also in MDS-RS compared to other WHO subtypes (fig. S6C), resulting from both a lower concentration of hepcidin and a higher concentration of ferritin in SF3B1MUT patients. The plasma concentration of ERFE was inversely correlated to the hepcidin/ferritin ratio (Pearson test; P<0.0001; r=0.600; fig. S6D). Our analysis also highlights that an ERFE concentration above a threshold of 100 ng/ml repressed hepcidin more efficiently (fig. S6D). Serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration was equally increased in SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT patients compared to normal values (5 – 36 U/l; table S1), and although ERFE is regulated by erythropoietin in mice, we did not find any correlation between serum EPO and ERFE concentration (fig. S6E) (28). The increased concentration of plasma ERFE was associated with a more pronounced degree of ineffective erythropoiesis, as assessed by a significant increase in plasma concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT MDS patients (P<0.0001; fig. S6F).To validate these findings, we prospectively enrolled an external cohort of lower risk MDS patients in our study until the proportion of patients with SF3B1MUT MDS was comparable to that in the training cohort (table S5). This validation cohort consisted of 55 patients with MDS, 42 (76.3%) of whom had MDS with SF3B1 mutation. Notably, SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT patients of this cohort received a similar transfusion burden with a mean number of 4 RBC units/8 weeks (table S5). The mean concentrations of ERFE and ferritin were significantly increased (P=0.0005 and P=0.0488, respectively; Fig. 5E, 5F), whereas hepcidin and hepcidin/ferritin ratio were significantly decreased in SF3B1MUT patients (P=0.0038 and P=0.0002, respectively; Fig. 5G, 5H). This confirms the results of the training cohort and suggests that the increase of ERFE concentration in SF3B1MUT MDS patients is independent of RBC transfusions.Iron homeostasis changes after RBC transfusions, which ameliorate the anemia and increase the concentrations of circulating iron, with both effects expected to increase hepcidin. To assess the influence of RBC transfusion in our analysis, we delineated a subset of 61 patients with MDS in the training cohort, including 25 SF3B1MUT and 36 SF3B1WT patients with a low transfusion burden before inclusion (<4 RBC units per 8 weeks). In this subset, patients with SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT MDS were equally transfused (mean 0.5 RBC unit/8 weeks), but ferritin and plasma iron concentrations remained higher in SF3B1MUT patients (fig. S7A, S7B). The hepcidin/ferritin and hepcidin/plasma iron ratios were significantly lower in SF3B1MUT patients (P<0.0001 and P=0.019, respectively; fig. S7C, S7D), and the circulating ERFE concentration remained significantly increased in low transfusion burden SF3B1MUT patients compared to SF3B1WT patients (P<0.0001; fig. S7E). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are used as first line treatment of anemia, with low serum EPO and low transfusion burden as predictors of response (25). We investigated the impact of iron parameters on the response to epoetin ζ for 12 weeks in 59 patients with low-risk MDS included in a clinical trial of the Groupe Francophone des Myélodysplasies (GFM), GFM-Retacrit-2013 (NCT 03598582; table S6) (32). Plasma ERFE, ferritin, and hepcidin concentrations at enrollment were similar in responding and non-responding patients, suggesting that these parameters were not predictive of the erythropoietic response in this cohort (fig. S8). We then explored the determinants of hyperferritinemia >300 μg/ml in low transfusion burden patients. By univariate analysis, ERFE (P=0.005), hepcidin (P=0.013), and SF3B1 mutation (P=0.006), but not sTfR concentration or the number of transfused RBC units, were significantly linked to the concentration of serum ferritin (Table 1). By multivariate analysis, ERFE, hepcidin, and SF3B1 mutation remained independent predictors of high ferritin concentration (Table 1). Altogether, these results indicate that before patients reach a critical threshold of transfusion dependence, hyperferritinemia can be caused by SF3B1MUT-induced expression of ERFE, which in turn lowers hepcidin.
Erythroid lineage-restricted expression of ERFE+12In mice, ERFE mRNA expression in the BM is regulated by EPO and is predominant in basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts (28). To investigate whether ERFE and ERFE+12 expression is restricted to the erythroid lineage, we amplified in parallel the erythroid and granulocytic precursors derived from the BM CD34+ cells of 1 SF3B1MUT and 1 SF3B1WT sample. The purity of each lineage was assessed by the cytological examination of May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained cytospins and the quantification of lineage-restricted markers by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6A & fig. S9A). To compare the amount of each transcript isoform at the different stages of differentiation, we quantified the canonical ERFEWT and the aberrant ERFE+12 by RT-qPCR. The expression of the canonical transcript ERFEWT expressed as Normalized Ratio Quantities (NRQ) increased in both SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT MDS erythroblasts. In granulocytes, the expression of ERFEWT was close to the limit of detection (Fig. 6B). The expression of ERFE+12 was restricted to the erythroid lineage, increased with the differentiation of SF3B1MUT erythroblasts, and was higher in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT erythroblasts (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that ERFE+12 expression is specific to the erythroid lineage.SF3B1 gene is mutated in 15% of patients suffering from CLL and the SF3B1MUT allele is present in CD19+ lymphocytes (14, 33). To investigate whether ERFE+12 was detectable in SF3B1MUT CLL, we collected one sample from a patient with CLL followed by MDS, whose BM MNC expressed a clonal SF3B1K700E mutation, and 3 peripheral blood (PB) MNC samples from 2 patients with CLL, one of whom harbored a clonal SF3B1T663I mutation with a variant allele frequency over 40% and the second had no mutation in SF3B1 gene, and from a patient with SF3B1K700E MDS. We analyzed the MAP3K7 transcript, which is alternatively spliced in SF3B1MUT CLL or MDS using a cryptic 3’ss (14, 16). A 170 nt fragment corresponding to the alternative MAP3K7 transcript was enriched in all SF3B1MUT samples compared to the SF3B1WT CLL (Fig. 6C). ERFE+12 was detected in the PB MNC of the SF3B1K700E MDS, but not in the SF3B1T663I or SF3B1WT CLL. ERFE+12 was not detected in BM MNC of the SF3B1K700E CLL+MDS sample. To get further insights on the cell types expressing ERFE+12, we sorted CD19+CD5− B cells, CD19+CD5+ pathological B cells, and CD3+ T cells and myeloid cells containing erythroblasts from the BM MNC fraction of the patients with SF3B1K700E CLL+MDS, SF3B1K700E MDS, and SF3B1WT MDS and from the PB MNC of the patient with SF3B1T663I CLL (fig. S9B). The number of cells in the myeloid fraction of SF3B1T663I CLL was too small for further studies. The 170 nt fragment of MAP3K7 was detected in CD19+CD5+ pathological B cells of SF3B1K700E CLL+MDS and SF3B1T663I CLL and also in the myeloid fraction, but not in the CD19+CD5− B cells of SF3B1K700E MDS (Fig. 6D). By sequencing SF3B1 RNA, we demonstrated that the mutation was present in the cell populations in which the alternative MAP3K7 transcript was detected (Fig. 6E). The alternative ERFE+12 transcript was not detected in the CD19+CD5+ pathological B cells of SF3B1K700E MDS+CLL or SF3B1T663I CLL, and its expression was restricted to SF3B1K700E myeloid MDS cells. Altogether, these results indicate that ERFE is expressed in erythroid cells and ERFE+12 is restricted to SF3B1MUT MDS myeloid cells.
Correlation between changes in ERFE+12 expression and the response to lenalidomideFifty percent of lower risk MDS patients, including patients with MDS-RS, experience primary resistance or secondary failure to treatments they receive to cure their anemia. Whether the mechanism of resistance involves the persistence of clonal erythropoiesis is always unknown. We have previously shown that lenalidomide administered to ESA-resistant non-del(5q) MDS patients targets the malignant clone and in some cases, eliminates the dominant SF3B1MUT clone for the duration of response (34). However, the frequency of the SF3B1 variant allele, which is expressed in erythroid and myeloid cells, does not only reflect the abundance of clonal erythroblasts. Here, we retrospectively monitored the expression of erythroid-specific ERFE+12 transcript for the follow-up of patients included in clinical trials of the GFM: GFM-Retacrit-2013 and GFM-LenEpo-2008 ((32,35). For this purpose, we performed a fluorescent PCR and integrated ERFE+12 and ERFEWT peak heights as a ratio ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT in SF3B1MUT MDS patients. Then, the ratio was measured in paired RNA samples at enrollment and first evaluation. In GFM-Retacrit-2013, 4 non-responders and 6 responders were compared, and no significant variation was observed (Fig. 7A, fig. S10A). By contrast, in GFM-LenEpo-2008, the ratio ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT decreased in 6 responding patients but remained stable in 8 non-responding patients (Fig. 7B, fig. S10B). The percent variation of ratios between samples obtained during screening and after 4 cycles of treatment was significantly different between responding and non-responding patients (Mann-Whitney test P=0.0013; Fig. 7B, right). The percent variation of SF3B1 variant allele frequency in BM mononuclear cells between screening and evaluation after 4 cycles was not significantly different between non-responding and responding patients (fig. S10C). This confirms that lenalidomide may target clonal erythropoiesis. By contrast, ERFE protein quantities did not vary with the response in both cohorts (fig. S11). Finally, we addressed the prognostic value of the ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT ratio for overall survival (OS) in a cohort of 90 patients with low-risk MDS, including 24 patients with SF3B1MUT and 66 with SF3B1WT enrolled at diagnosis with a median follow-up of 36.9 months (table S7). In this cohort, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis established that a value of 0.008 was the threshold of positivity of the ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT ratio with a specificity and sensitivity of 100%. As shown in Fig. 7C, an ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT ratio >0.008, was predictive of better OS (log-rank test; P=0.019) and was correlated with the presence of an SF3B1 mutation Among patients expressing the variant ERFE+12 transcript, there was no significant correlation between ERFE+12/ERFE+12+ERFEWT ratio and OS (log-rank test; P=0.064; fig. S12). Our results suggest that ERFE+12 expression may correlate with OS for SF3B1MUT MDS patients.
Discussion
In this study, we show that in patients with SF3B1MUT MDS, an alternative FAM132B/ERFE+12 transcript is translated into an ERFEVPFQ protein and, together with the canonical transcript, contributes to the overexpression of ERFE. Similarly to ERFE, the ERFEVPFQ protein efficiently represses hepcidin. ERFE+12 is specifically induced by the clonal erythropoiesis.
In SF3B1MUT cancers, alternative 3’ss usages are the most frequent splicing aberrancies (11, 13, 14, 36). The recently resolved crystal structure of SF3b complex helps understanding this feature (37). In the spliceosome, SF3b complex interacts with the pre-mRNA and is involved in the branch site selection during splicing. Mutations in SF3B1 affect the structure of SF3b RNA-binding platform, resulting in the selection of alternative branch site and alternative transcripts, of which more than 50% are subjected to NMD (11, 13, 37). Based on these findings, we focused our attention on the transcripts generated by the use of an alternative AG’. The analysis of the distance separating AG from AG’ revealed strong peaks at 15, 18, and 21 nucleotides, showing that inserts could be multiples of 3 nucleotides. Among alternative in-frame junctions, we identified two regulators of iron homeostasis, ABCB7 and ERFE. As already reported, the alternative ABCB7 mRNA results from the addition of 21 nucleotides between exon 8 and 9 and, in our sample set, was slightly down-regulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT MDS (11, 15, 16). By contrast, the aberrant ERFE transcript modified by the addition of 12 nucleotides was up-regulated 2.3 fold in SF3B1MUT MDS. ERFE+12 has not been reported in other SF3B1MUT cancers despite some overlap between the sets of alternative 3’ss transcripts in SF3B1MUT uveal melanoma, CLL, and MDS (11, 13, 14, 38, 39). We showed the existence of a variant protein containing VPFQ sequence immediately upstream of the collagen domain putatively involved in protein-protein interactions in other CTRP family members (40). VPFQ may not influence protein conformation, because the apparent molecular weight was similar for recombinant ERFEWT and ERFEVPFQ proteins, which both repressed HAMP gene expression. However, we could not exclude an effect of the VPFQ insertion on protein stability and/or still unknown functions.
In MDS, serum EPO is increased but ineffective in stimulating erythropoiesis because maturing erythroid cells undergo apoptosis in terminal phases of differentiation (1, 2). Increased EPO and sTfR concentrations have been inversely correlated with hepcidin concentrations in MDS (19, 20, 41, 42). Our study indicates that plasma hepcidin concentration in SF3B1MUT MDS is similar to healthy non-blood donor controls and inappropriately low compared to SF3B1WT MDS, suggesting that its production could be dysregulated by severe ineffective erythropoiesis and/or a more specific mechanism (19). We showed the cell-autonomous SF3B1MUT-dependent expression of ERFE+12 and a role for increased concentrations of circulating ERFE in hepcidin reduction. This confirms the involvement of ERFE in human pathologies (29).
ERFE is the major erythroid regulator of hepcidin (28). Other candidate regulators of hepcidin linked to erythropoiesis have been proposed, including EPO and GDF-15. Although EPO administration decreases hepcidin concentration (43), this effect is predominantly indirect. The other candidate, GDF-15, is poorly induced by EPO in human volunteers. Although serum GDF-15 concentration was increased in β-thalassemia or congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, it was not inversely correlated with hepcidin in MDS (19, 26, 44). Low hepcidin preserves ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages, causing increased iron intestinal absorption and macrophage release (45, 46). Compared to SF3B1WT MDS, the lower concentrations of hepcidin in SF3B1MUT MDS may explain early iron overload, before patients receive erythrocyte transfusions (19, 20). In patients with low transfusion burden, who had received a mean of 0.5 RBC unit, hepcidin, ERFE and SF3B1 mutation were independent predictors of hyperferritinemia. This demonstrates that iron overload is strongly related to the control of hepcidin through the SF3B1-regulated production of ERFE. Hepcidin increases with transfusion intensity in patients with MDS or β-thalassemia because of exogenous iron loading and transient suppression of ineffective erythropoiesis (29, 47, 48). Here, in regularly transfused SF3B1MUT MDS patients, hepcidin remained lower and ERFE higher than in SF3B1WT MDS patients. This establishes a driver role for SF3B1 mutation in the stimulation of ERFE expression and systemic iron overload that characterized patients.
The SF3B1 mutation confers a good prognosis in MDS (6, 49). However, when patients are transfusion-dependent, iron overload in cardiac and liver tissues becomes clinically evident and may impair life expectancy (50). Chelation efficiently reduces iron burden in regularly transfused MDS patients and serves as an adjuvant therapy for anemia, because deferasirox may improve hematopoiesis by protecting against oxidative stress (51–53). Promising substitutes for ESAs in resistant patients include lenalidomide, which may transiently reduce SF3B1 mutant allele burden, and activin receptor ligand traps such as luspatercept, which promotes late-stage erythropoiesis in mouse models of β-thalassemia and MDS and diminishes iron overload in β-thalassemia mice (34, 54–56). In lenalidomide-treated patients, but not in epoetin ζ-treated patients, the kinetics of ERFE+12 expression correlated with the response to treatment, indicating that in responding patients lenalidomide targeted clonal erythroid precursors either directly or indirectly. Of note, changes in plasma ERFE protein after lenalidomide were not correlated with the response to these treatments. The impact of transfusions on the regulation of ERFE expression at the post-transcriptional level should be examined in the future. ERFE+12 expression could also be useful for disease surveillance of patients with MDS-RS treated with other drugs, such as luspatercept. Further clinical studies will be required to validate ERFE+12 expression as a therapy-responsive biomarker of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with SF3B1MUT MDS.
Finally, our findings open therapeutic avenues for preventing iron accumulation in MDS-RS patients. Increasing hepcidin could produce therapeutic benefits in SF3B1MUT MDS, because a moderate increase in hepcidin decreased iron and improved anemia in β-thalassemia mice (57). Therefore, either the administration of a hepcidin agonist or the targeting of erythroferrone overexpression may provide a potential strategy for preventing iron overload and improving erythropoiesis in SF3B1MUT MDS patients.
Materials and Methods
Study designThe study involved identifying a splicing variant of ERFE by RNA-sequencing human primary BM samples and the variant peptide by mass spectrometry. Each in vitro experiments transfection, minigene assay, degron-KI, transcriptional repression of hepcidin was repeated three times. Each experiment using primary cells was performed with at least three samples in each category. A ratio of ERFE variant transcript to total transcript was validated as a marker of clonal erythropoiesis based on the response to lenalidomide or ESA in two cohorts of MDS patients enrolled in clinical trials and as a prognostic marker of overall survival in a prospective multicenter cohort of MDS patients. Predictive value of plasma erythroferrone and hepcidin concentrations for hyperferritinemia was measured in training and validation cohorts of MDS patients. For these studies, randomization or blinding were not applicable
PatientsFor the training cohort, MDS patients (n=156) were enrolled between 2008 and 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov: GFM-LenEpo-2008, NCT01718379; GFM-Retacrit-2013, NCT 03598582). For the GFM-Retacrit-2013 cohort, the status of response to epoetin ζ was recorded. The prospective cohort of 90 MDS patients with survival data was enrolled between 2010 and 2018. BM aspirates and PB plasma samples were collected after each patient gave informed consent for biological investigations according to the recommendations of the institutional review boards (IRB): IdF X GFM-LenEpo-08 EudraCT 2008-008262-12; IdFII 2010-A00033-36; IdFIII: 2010-2753; IdFV 212-A01395-38 EudraCT 2012-002990-7338; OncoCCH 2015-08-11-DC). For the validation cohort, MDS patients (n=55) were enrolled prospectively for plasma collection in France (5 centers; IRB Onco-CCH 2015-08-11DC) and Germany (one center; IRB Ethikkommission an der TU Dresden; EK 115032015) between 2016 and 2018. BM samples from 5 age-matched controls and PB plasma samples from 20 healthy controls were collected. Patient characteristics are indicated in tables S1, S5, and S7 and according to the response to epoetin ζ in table S6. Low transfusion burden was defined as <4 RBC units per 8 weeks.
DNA and RNA-sequencingMutations in a panel of 26 genes were screened by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (fig. S1). RNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using a 100-bp paired-end sequencing strategy. TopHat (v2.0.6) was used to align the reads against the human reference genome Hg19 RefSeq (RNA sequences, GRCh37) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Analyses of differential gene expression analysis and differential junction read counts were performed using DESeq2 (13, 30).
CRISPR/Cas9 generation of isogenic Sf3b1K700E and Sf3b1WT cell linesThe murine erythroid cell line G1E-ER4 (58) was used to generate isogenic Sf3b1K700E and Sf3b1WT cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9-stimulated homology-mediated repair.
ERFE and ENOSF1 minigenesThe ERFE minigene was synthesized by insertion of the ERFE alternative junction in pET01 Exontrap vector (Mobitec). G1E-ER4 9.2 (SF3B1WT) and G1E-ER4 5.13H (SF3B1K700E) cells were transfected and processed for fluorescent PCR.
Mass spectrometry analysisErythroblasts were lysed and peptides were obtained by trypsin digestion (Promega) and analyzed by nano liquid chromatography coupled with a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo). Data were analyzed using Mascot 2.5.1 (www.matrixscience.com).
Human erythroferrone quantificationPlasma erythroferrone concentration was determined as previously described (29).
Statistical analysisFor quantitative variables, values were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using X2 or Fisher’s exact tests. P-values<0.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to calculate the thresholds of positivity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adjusted for selected variables chosen with a P-value<0.1 in univariate analysis (JMP version 10.0.2, SAS Institute Inc.).
