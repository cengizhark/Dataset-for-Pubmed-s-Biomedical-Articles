Introduction
Bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR) are members of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of receptors (de Caestecker, 2004; Mehra and Wrana, 2002). Heteromeric complexes form between BMPRI and BMPRII (Gilboa et al., 2000). Aberrant BMP signaling has been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Various germline mutations in Bmpr2 have been identified in familial and even sporadic forms of the disease (Deng et al., 2000; Lane et al., 2000; Thomson et al., 2001). Moreover, independent of a mutation, expression of Bmpr2 (Atkinson et al., 2002) and of Bmpr1a (Du et al., 2003) are reduced in lungs of PAH patients.
PAH is a potentially fatal disease (Abenhaim et al., 1996) characterized by both obliteration of proximal pulmonary arteries resulting from VSMC proliferation and migration (Jeffery and Morrell, 2002) and loss of distal arteries associated with endothelial cell (EC) (Campbell et al., 2001) and pericyte apoptosis (Zhao et al., 2003). These pathological features account for the progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance culminating in right heart failure (Humbert et al., 2004; Rubin, 1997).
Mice homozygous null for Bmpr2 (Beppu et al., 2000), Bmpr1a (Mishina et al., 1995), the ligand Bmp4 (Winnier et al., 1995), and the effector Smad4 (Sirard et al., 1998) die early in embryonic life for lack of mesodermal induction. In mice with FLK1-targeted deletion of Bmpr1a (Park et al., 2006) (FLK1-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox), lethality occurs between E10.5 and E11.5, in association with massive abdominal hemorrhage. These mice exhibit dilatation of large vessels owing to poor recruitment of VSMC around the EC layer, but it is not clear if the vascular phenotype is due to Bmpr1a-deficient EC or SMC (Park et al., 2006).
In this study, we determined whether VSMC-deletion of Bmpr1a could cause abnormalities in vasculogenesis that might explain a propensity to PAH. We bred mice expressing floxed Bmpr1a and ROSA26 with SM22α-Cre mice. Progeny homozygous for deletion of Bmpr1a SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox died soon after E11 with massive vascular and pericardial hemorrhage. These mice had a thin ventricular wall and aneurysmal dilatation of large vessels associated with reduced myocyte proliferation related to decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities. Defective brain development also documented in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice was associated with impaired clearing of brain microvessels and related to resistance of pericytes to apoptosis and decreased MMP-2.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Model: SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox MiceWe crossed SM22α-Cre mice with mice homozygous for the floxed Bmpr1a gene (Mishina et al., 2002) and the Cre reporter gene, ROSA26 (R26R) (Soriano, 1999) (Bmpr1aflox/flox;R26R+/+). F2 breeding was then realized by backcrossing F1 mice (SM22α-Cre;R26R+/-;Bmpr1aflox/+) with the Bmpr1aflox/flox;R26R+/+ mice to produce mice that are SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox (flox/flox). All studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee at Stanford University in accordance with the guidelines of the American Physiological Society.
GenotypingPolymerase chain reactions (PCR) were used to amplify Cre (Saam and Gordon, 1999), R26R (Soriano, 1999) genes, the floxed Bmpr1a gene (Mishina et al., 2002), and the Bmpr1a gene with exon2 deletion (Mishina et al., 2002) using DNA extracted from embryonic yolk sacs.
Preparation of Embryos for Histological AnalysesIsolated E9.5-E11 mouse embryos were fixed with formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered serum (PBS), embedded in paraffin and cut transversely (7 μm in thickness).
Histology and immunostainingParaffin sections of brains, hearts, and dorsal aortae of formalin-fixed embryos were stained with H&E to assess the phenotype resulting from deletion of Bmpr1a. To assess apoptosis, we performed the Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End-Labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Oligo Ligation Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, S7200). Sections were counterstained with Methyl Green (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).To assess alpha smooth muscle actin (αSM-actin) or the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), formalin-fixed tissue sections were incubated with either mouse anti-αSM-actin antibody (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) or with biotinylated mouse anti-PCNA antibody (1:100, Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). For αSM-actin staining, sections were then incubated with goat anti-mouse-biotinylated antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). For both αSM-actin and PCNA staining, sections were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). Brown immunoreactivity was observed by subjecting the sections to diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB; Vector Labs). Sections stained with antibodies to αSM-actin and PCNA were counterstained with Hematoxylin and Methyl Green (Vector Labs), respectively.To assess apoptosis in brain pericytes, TUNEL assay using Apoptag Red in Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon) was followed by immunostaining using the pericyte marker, NG2, primary antibody (1:100, Chemicon) using formalin fixed-head sections.Expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aortic walls and heart was analyzed in tissue sections of PFA-fixed embryos incubated with either an anti-MMP-2 (Ab-4) mouse mAb (75-7F7) or an anti-MMP-9 (Ab-3) mouse mAb (56-2A4) (1:100, Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:200 Molecular Probe, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).To assess BMP10 signaling in embryo hearts, PFA-fixed tissue sections were incubated with a p57kip2 primary antibody clone 57P06 (1:100, Neomarkers,Fremont, CA) followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:250, BMK-2202, MOM Kit, Vector Labs) and ABC reagent (PK6100, ABC Elite Kit, Vector labs). Sections were then subjected to DAB+ (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and counterstained with Hematoxylin.
Whole-mount LacZ StainingE8.5-E10.5 PFA-fixed mouse embryos were stained with 0.7mg/ml X-gal to be assessed under the microscope or were sectioned and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Labs).
Whole-mount PECAM StainingPFA-fixed E10.5 mouse embryos were incubated with PECAM antibody (1:100, rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1) (clone MEC13.3, BD Pharmingen™, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:500, , Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Embryos were then subjected to DAB substrate (Vector Labs), cleared (benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate) for better visualization of the vascular tree and then assessed under the microscope or sectioned and counterstained with Methyl Green (Vector Labs) for histological analysis.
Primary Cell Cultures and RNA Interference (RNAi)Adult human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) and human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) were cultured as previously described (El-Bizri et al., 2008). Cells were transiently transfected with control, human Bmpr1a, MMP-9 or MMP-2 siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayatte, CO) in OPTIMEM I (Gibco, Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). ‘Starvation media’ (media supplemented with 0.1% FBS) were added 6 hours later for a total of 48 hours.
Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was extracted from whole E9.5 embryos or from HPASMC or HBVP and then reverse transcribed as previously reported (El-Bizri et al., 2008). Gene expression levels were quantified using a pre-verified Assay on-Demand TaqMan primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and normalized to 18S and β2M for murine and human samples, respectively, using the comparative delta-CT method.
Cell Proliferation (MTT) and Apoptosis (Caspase 3 and 7 Activities)Forty-eight hours following transfection in 0.1% FBS, HPASMC were exposed to 10% FBS for 72 hours, and cell growth was assessed by the MTT cell proliferation assay (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and by cell counts. Transfected HBVP were kept under serum-free conditions for an additional 24 hours after which apoptosis was assessed by measuring the caspase-3 and -7 activities using the Caspase 3/Caspase 7 Luminescent Assay Kit, Caspase-Glo™ (Promega, Madison, WI) and proliferation was assessed by MTT assay.
Cell Migration Assay (Boyden Chambers)Migration was assessed using a modified Boyden Chamber (BD Falcon™, BD Biosciences) as previously described (Leung et al., 2004). SiControl and SiBmpr1a transfected HPASMC were stimulated to migrate for 6 hours in 0.1% FBS for baseline measurements and in response to 10% FBS or PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) used as chemo-attractants in the lower compartments of the chambers.
Gelatin ZymographyConditioned media collected from the upper compartments of the Boyden Chambers to evaluate production of MMPs in HPASMC migrating in response to 0.1% FBS, 10% FBS, or PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) and from HBVP after 48 hours of serum starvation as well as extracts of individual mouse embryos were used for gelatin zymography. The supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis carried out on an 8% SDS-PAGE co-polymerized with gelatin (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) (Cann et al., 2008). The gelatinolytic activities were detected as transparent bands against the background of Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gelatin and quantified using ImageJ.
Statistical AnalysisValues for each determination are expressed as mean±s.e.m.. For comparisons made to assess two groups, statistical significance was determined using the unpaired two-tailed t-Test. For comparisons of multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test was carried out. The number of mouse embryos or samples used in each experiment is provided in the Figure legends.
Results
Embryonic Lethality in Transgenic Mice with SM22α-Targeted Deletion of Bmpr1aMouse embryos were genotyped as described under “Methods” and illustrated in Fig. 1A. Ubiquitous expression of Bmpr1a is observed early in mouse development starting at E6.5 (Mishina et al., 1995; Roelen et al., 1997). To assess the profile of Cre activity reflecting areas of Bmpr1a deletion, we performed whole-mount LacZ staining on SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/+ mouse embryos at E8.5-10.5 (Fig. 1B). Cre activity was evident in the heart from E8.5 (data not shown) by blue LacZ staining and in the heart and vasculature at E9.25 (Fig. 1B-a). At E10.5, smaller intersomitic vascular branches and somitic myotomes showed positive LacZ staining (Fig. 1B-b).SM22α-Cre;R26R; Bmpr1aflox/flox mice appeared normal until E9.5 (Fig. 1C-b vs. WT in a). By E10.5, they were somewhat reduced in size (Fig. 1C-d vs. WT in c), and at E11, the mice showed massive perivascular and pericardial hemorrhage (Fig. 1C-f vs. WT in e) and died soon after. Following the breeding strategy we describe in the “Methods”, the expected frequency of the flox/flox genotype was 25%. This frequency was observed by genotyping embryos at different ages up to E11-11.5; the frequency was 10% at E12.5, and there were no fetuses with this genotype by E18.0 or in postnatal mice assessed after weaning (Fig. 1D).
Cardiac Defect in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox Embryos: Thinning of the Myocardium Associated with Reduced ProliferationCre activity was confined to atrial and ventricular myocytes, with no expression in the endocardium of E10.5 flox/flox embryos by whole-mount LacZ staining(Fig. 2A,B). Myocardial-deletion by SM22a-Cre is consistent with transient expression of SM22α in the developing heart (Li et al., 1996; Umans et al., 2007).To assess the sequelae of loss of Bmpr1a in cardiomyocytes on embryonic cardiac development, histological analysis of heart sections of viable E10.5-E11 SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox and age-matched littermate control embryos (WT) was carried out to show the four chambers and outflow tract anatomy at multiple levels. We noted thinning of the ventricular wall in the flox/flox vs. WT hearts (Fig. 2D vs. C), quantified as a ~35% reduction in the number of ventricular cells per heart section (P<0.05) (Fig. 2E). The cardiac phenotype was not due to enhanced apoptosis as only the occasional TUNEL positive cell was seen (Fig. 2F,G) but rather associated with attenuated cell proliferation. There was a reduction in the percent of PCNA positive over total number of ventricular cells in heart sections of the flox/flox (Fig. 2I) vs. WT (Fig. 2H) (P <0.05) (Fig. 2J) at E9.5 that persisted at E10.5-11. As Bmp10-deficient embryos showed thinning of the myocardium associated with decreased cell proliferation and ectopic expression of p57kip2 (Chen et al., 2004), we assessed the expression of p57kip2 by immunofluorescence for the possibility that a deletion of Bmpr1a in the heart could lead to a defect in BMP10 signaling. Our results showed no difference in immunoreactivity between mutant (Fig. 2L) and. WT hearts (Fig. 2K).
Vascular Defect in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox Embryos: Dilatation of Large Vessels Associated with Reduced Proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle CellsTo characterize the vascular defect resulting in perivascular hemorrhage and lethality in flox/flox embryos, we performed whole-mount PECAM staining on embryos at E10.5. Gross morphological examination revealed massive dilatation of the large vessels appreciated in the dorsal aortae, mesenteric (Fig. 3A-b, d, f) and cranial vessels (not shown) of the mutants vs.WT littermates (Fig. 3A-a, c, e). Figure 3A also showed more ramifications or interconnections in the interlimb vessels of the flox/flox (e) vs. WT (f) embryos. Transverse H&E stained sections of E10.5 embryos showed dilated aortae (Fig. 3A-h) in flox/flox embryos relative to WT controls (Fig. 3A-g).Whole-mount staining revealed poor investment of SM22α-Cre expressing LacZ positive cells in the dilated aortic wall of the SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mutants. (Fig. 3A-j) vs WT (Fig. 3A-i) where thick LacZ staining was evident. The LacZ positive cells were identified as of SM lineage by immunoperoxidase staining using an antibody for αSM-actin. There were also fewer surrounding mesenchymal cells expressing αSM-actin in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox embryos (Fig. 3B-b) vs. WT (Fig. 3B-a). TUNEL staining on sections of aorta revealed only occasional positive mesenchymal cells (arrows in Fig. 3B-c,d). Instead, the decreased number of αSM-actin positive perivascular cells was consistent with reduced proliferation as assessed by PCNA staining (arrows in Fig. 3B-f vs. WT in e). Quantitative analysis revealed a ~53% reduction in the percent of PCNA positive SMC forming the vessel wall (Fig. 3g) (P<0.05). PECAM stained sections did not reveal a difference in the number of EC surrounding the dilated vessels, but the cells appeared ‘stretched’ (data not shown).
Defective Brain Development of SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox Embryos Associated with Impaired Clearing of Small VesselsCre activity was seen in the forebrain of an E10.5 WT embryo by whole-mount LacZ staining (Fig. 4A). To characterize and better visualize any brain development abnormality, we examined heads of embryos incubated with ethidium bromide under UV light. Compared to WT (Fig. 4B-a,c), flox/flox mutant embryos (Fig. 4B-b,d) showed brain compression and collapse of telancephalic vesicles. These defects were apparent in H&E stained transverse sections of the heads at multiple levels (Fig. 4B-f, h, j, and l). To determine how loss of Bmpr1a in SM22α expressing cells could impair brain development, we performed whole-mount PECAM staining on embryos at E9.5 and E10.5. We observed similar brain vessel distribution in the WT and flox/flox mutants at E9.5 (data not shown), however, at E10.5, we noted evidence of clearing of telancephalic vessels in the WT (Fig. 4C-a,c) but not the mutants (Fig. 4C-b,d).Transverse sections of the PECAM stained brains at the level of the nasal-mandibullar processes showed histologic evidence of clearing of vessels in the WT heads (Fig. 4C-e) while flox/flox mutant heads (Fig. 4C-f) showed persistent vessels (brown). To determine if the clearing of vessels is related to apoptosis, TUNEL assay was performed on brain sections. TUNEL positive cells were plentiful in the WT (Fig. 4C-g) but were almost absent in the flox/flox mutant heads (Fig. 4C-h). Quantitative analysis showed a ~62% reduction in the percent of TUNEL positive over total number of cells in the flox/flox group (Fig. 4C-k) (*P<0.05).Since pericytes express SM22α (Ding et al., 2004), we speculated that loss of Bmpr1a in these cells led to resistance to apoptosis and reduced clearing of brain microvessels. We therefore performed fluorescent TUNEL assay followed by fluorescent immunostaining towards NG2, a pericyte marker. Reduced apoptosis was associated with an increased number of pericytes in the mutant (Fig.4-j) vs. WT (Fig.4C-i) brains. Since co-localization of the TUNEL and NG2 was not observed in the WT brain (Fig.4C-i) we could not confirm ongoing apoptosis of pericytes, suggesting that this occurred before E10.5. Persistence of brain microvessels was not due to enhanced cell growth, since PCNA immunoreactivity showed no difference between E10.5 WT and flox/flox mutants (Fig.4C-l).
Reduced MMP-9 and MMP-2 in Embryos with SM22α-Targeted Deletion of Bmpr1aWe investigated the level of expression of candidate genes dysregulated by loss of Bmpr1a that could account both for resistance to apoptosis in pericytes and repression of proliferation in VSMC. For example, BMPs increase MMP activity and mRNA expression (Mishina et al., 2004; Palosaari et al., 2003) and MMPs can regulate cell survival (Jones et al., 1997) and induce proliferation of VSMC (Zempo et al., 1994). Quantitative RT-PCR was applied to embryonic extracts to assess differential expression of MMPs and other extracellular matrix genes that could be modulated by loss of Bmpr1a and could account for these altered vascular cell phenotypes. Many of the genes that we assessed were also modified in other embryonic mouse models of vascular dilatation (Oh et al., 2000). As well, we assessed levels of genes implicated in vasculo/angiogenesis, i.e. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the angiopoietins (Angpt1, Angpt2). We also assessed transcript levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN), a known gene downstream of BMP signaling implicated in juvenile polyposis (He et al., 2004) that might also impact cell growth (Beck and Carethers, 2007). RNA was extracted from E9.5 embryos, preceding the appearance of the phenotype in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice. We found a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of MMP-9 (P<0.05) and MMP-2 (P<0.05) while trends toward reduced expression of tenascin C, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were observed (Fig. 5A). No differences in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Fig. 5A), Angpt1, Angpt2, VEGF (data not shown), and PTEN (Fig. 5A) mRNA levels were noted between the WT and mutants.This decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 transcripts was associated with a decrease, though statistically not significant, in the pro (40%) and active (30%) forms of MMP-2 in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mutants vs. WT as assessed by gelatin zymography using mouse embryos (data not shown).To determine if the decrease in mRNA levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in whole E9.5 mutant embryos is translated into reduced protein expression at a later age, we performed immunostaining of MMP-9 and MMP-2 at E10.5. We found abundant MMP-9 and, to a greater extent, MMP-2 in the aortic walls of WT embryos (Fig. 5B-a and c) and only weak immunoreactivity in the mutants (Fig. 5B-b and d). However, a low and diffuse immunostaining was noted in the heart and brains of WT and mutants (data not shown).
Loss of Bmpr1a Attenuates Proliferation and Directed Migration of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and Induces Pericyte Resistance to Apoptosis via Reduced MMP-9 and MMP-2Subsequent studies were carried out using cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) and human brain (micro)vascular pericytes (HBVP) to determine (1) whether reducing levels of Bmpr1a by RNAi would result in suppression of MMP-9 and/or MMP-2 activities and (2) whether reducing Bmpr1a, MMP-9, and/or MMP-2, represses proliferation of VSMC and induces resistance to apoptosis in pericytes. We reduced the mRNA level of Bmpr1a by 66% by transfecting HPASMC with Bmpr1a siRNA, and observed, by gelatin zymography, that SiBmpr1a transfected cells had decreased levels of pro and active forms of MMP-9 (P<0.05 for both) and of MMP-2 (P<0.01, and P<0.05, respectively) vs. siControl transfected cells (Fig. 6A).Consistent with our hypothesis and our findings in the embryo, we showed that RNAi-mediated reduction in mRNA of Bmpr1a by 66%, MMP-9 (to undetectable levels), or MMP-2 (by >80%) resulted in a 35-40% reduction in HPASMC proliferation in response to 10% FBS as assessed by MTT assay (P<0.001, Fig. 6B) and cell counts (data not shown). Since MMP-9 and MMP-2 increase in migrating SMC (Bendeck et al., 2002; Franco et al., 2006; Kuzuya et al., 2003; Mason et al., 1999), we determined whether the chemotactic migratory behavior of SMC was impaired by loss of Bmpr1a, in association with reduced MMP-9 and/or MMP-2. A deficiency in SMC migration could also account for lack of SMC investment of the aneurysmally dilated vessels in flox/flox embryos. We serum starved HPASMC in 0.1% FBS for 48 hours and then assessed their response to a 6 hour treatment with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) using a modified Boyden Chamber assay. The MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities in siControl HPASMC, as assessed by gelatin zymography, were repressed in siBmpr1a treated cells (P<0.01 for MMP-9 and P<0.001 for proMMP-2 and MMP-2) (Fig. 7A). Although basal levels of migration were increased in SiBmpr1a transfected HPASMC (P<0.001), these cells did not significantly migrate in response to PDGF-BB when compared with siControl HPASMC (P<0.05) (Fig. 7B).We then investigated whether pericytes with loss of Bmpr1a would be resistant to apoptosis due to a reduction in MMP-2 activity, since MMP-2 activity is proapoptogenic in pericytes of diabetic patients (Yang et al., 2007). Using RNAi under conditions of serum starvation (0.1% FBS) for 48 hours, we showed a 53% reduction in Bmpr1a transcript levels in HBVP. To induce apoptosis, cells were serum deprived for an additional 24 hours, after which a reduction in both pro and active forms of MMP-2 was demonstrated by gelatin zymography (P<0.05) (Fig. 8A). We then used RNAi to reduce mRNA levels of MMP-2 in HBVP and confirmed the decrease in pro and active forms of MMP-2 by gelatin zymography (P<0.001) (Fig. 8B). Transfecting HBVP with SiBmpr1a, or with SiMMP-2 induced resistance to apoptosis when compared to SiControl HBVP (P<0.001) as assessed by caspase-3 and -7 activities (Fig. 8C) without affecting cell proliferation as assessed by MTT assay (data not shown). Therefore lack of MMP-2 in pericytes could account for the resistance to apoptosis seen in highly vascularized areas of flox/flox mutant brains.
Discussion
Bmpr1a in cardiac developmentThe cardiac phenotype in E10.5 SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mouse embryos was characterized by thinning of the ventricular wall and attributed to reduced cell proliferation evident at E9.5. Bmp10-null mice also develop hearts with hypoplastic walls owing to reduced proliferation of cardiomycocytes at E9.0-E9.5 (Chen et al., 2004). However, our results showed that BMP10 signaling in E10.5 SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox heart sections was not affected by Bmpr1a deletion.It is interesting that in the mouse in which Bmpr1a was deleted following activation of the cardiac myocyte specific promoter alpha myosin heavy chain, (αMHC-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox) (Gaussin et al., 2002), the ventricular thinning that took place at a later time point (E11.5-E12.5) was attributed to enhanced apoptosis. Ventricular thinning was also seen at E11.5-E12.5 in mice with loss of Bmpr1a in Islet1 cardiac progenitors (Yang et al., 2006) or at E11.5 with cardiac-specific ablation of Smad4 (Song et al., 2007) and associated both with attenuated proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of the ventricular septal myocytes. This suggests that differences in the timing of promoter activation and Bmpr1a deletion in cardiomyocytes may dictate whether the thinning of the ventricular wall will be the result of apoptosis and/or reduced proliferation.
Bmpr1a and vasculogenesisWe cannot exclude the possibility that the myocardial thinning is secondary to a hemodynamic abnormality caused by the vascular phenotype observed in the SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox embryos, and characterized by aneurysmal dilation of the dorsal aorta and other large vessels. Dilatation of the aorta was observed in embryos with FLK1-Bmpr1a deletion (FLK1-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox) (Park et al., 2006) and in Alk1 (Oh et al., 2000) and Smad5 (Yang et al., 1999) null embryos. In those models the dilatation was attributed to a paracrine effect of Bmpr1a-deficient EC repressing the recruitment of VSMC or pericytes, as observed in mice lacking PDGF-BB or the PDFG-Rβ (Hellstrom et al., 1999; Lindahl et al., 1997). Other possibilities suggested included poor transdifferentiation of EC into SMC, or a defect in SMC growth affecting vessel maturation and integrity (Park et al., 2006). The third explanation fits best with the further delineation of the phenotype of SM22α-Cre;R26R; Bmpr1aflox/flox embryos, that we carried out.We were able to assess the impact of Bmpr1a deletion in reducing VSMC proliferation in the tissue as well as in cultured cells, where we also observed impaired PDGF-BB-directed VSMC migration. No defect in the EC layer was noted in the SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox embryos by whole-mount PECAM immunostaining (data not shown) that might explain the vascular defect through a non-cell autonomous contribution. In addition, we did not observe upregulation of angiogenic factors, such as Angpt1 and Angpt2, as described in Alk1 null embryos (Oh et al., 2000) or VEGF as observed in both FLK1-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox (Park et al., 2006) and Alk1 nulls (Oh et al., 2000). It follows that there was no concomitant angiogenic defect in SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mutant embryos such as the impaired yolk sac vascular remodeling seen in the FLK1-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox (Park et al., 2006) and the Alk1 null (Oh et al., 2000) embryos. Since FLK1 is a mesodermal marker and Alk1 is mostly expressed in EC, the angiogenic defect in the yolk sac is likely due to the loss of Bmpr1a in EC, a feature we reproduced by ablating Bmpr1a using Tie2-Cre (our unpublished observations). In contrast to other mice models of aneurysmal vascular dilatation, the SM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice did not exhibit an increase in expression of proteases such as uPA or tPA (Oh et al., 2000; Park et al., 2006). In contrast to the Smad5 null embryos with dilated aorta, the SM22α-Cre;R26R; Bmpr1aflox/flox embryos did not show apoptosis in VSMC or in neighboring mesenchymal cells (Yang et al., 1999).When we assessed gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins and proteinases previously implicated in VSMC proliferation and migration, a consistent reduction in the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2, genes downstream of BMP signaling in other cell types (Mishina et al., 2004; Palosaari et al., 2003) was observed. A direct association between reduced Bmpr1a and impaired production of MMP-9 and MMP-2 was then demonstrated in cultured VSMC, where knock-down of Bmpr1a by RNAi, attenuated MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities. The role of both MMP-9 and MMP-2 in VSMC proliferation and migration is well documented (Bendeck et al., 2002; Franco et al., 2006; Kuzuya et al., 2003; Mason et al., 1999). Gene expression of PTEN, downstream of Bmpr1a implicated in juvenile polyposis and affecting cell growth, was not modified in the mutants.Our observations linking reduced MMP-9 and MMP-2 to aneurysmal dilatation may seem at odds with clinical studies in human tissue in which increased MMP-2 and especially MMP-9 are observed in abdominal aortic aneurysm (Goodall et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 1995). Moreover, reduction of MMP-9 activity by Doxycycline, protects against experimentally-induced aortic aneurysm (Kaito et al., 2003), as does local expression of TIMP-1, an inhibitor of MMP-9 activity (Allaire et al., 1998; McMillan et al., 1995). In addition, mice that are null for MMP-9 are resistant to elastase-induced aortic aneurysms (Pyo et al., 2000). It therefore appears that during vascular development, a reduction in both MMP-9 and MMP-2 in SMC is required to produce aneurysmal dilatation, as a result of reduced proliferation and perhaps migration of SMC. It is interesting that the MMP-2/-9 double nulls (Lambert et al., 2003) do not recapitulate our phenotype. This could reflect compensatory induction of other MMPs in response to a global rather than a tissue specific deletion. Alternatively, the mixed background of the flox/flox mutants compared with the C57BL/6J background of the MMP-2/-9 double nulls may have accounted for the difference in the phenotype.
Bmpr1a expression in pericytes mediates vessel regression during brain developmentSM22α-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1aflox/flox mutants showed severe brain asymmetry and collapse of telancephalic vesicles, and a vascular defect produced by impaired BMPRIA signaling and not previously described, may explain these abnormalities.Regression of vessels is critical in triggering mesenchymal condensation culminating in chondrogenesis and skeletogenesis (Yin and Pacifici, 2001). As MMP-2 activity is linked to retinal pericyte apoptosis in diabetic retinopathy (Yang et al., 2007), we reasoned that suppression of MMP-2 resulting from lack of BMPRIA signaling might make pericytes resistant to apoptosis preventing EC apoptosis and microvessel clearing, and subsequently leading to defective brain development. Indeed, we showed that lack of Bmpr1a or MMP-2 by RNAi renders pericytes in culture resistant to apoptosis.The same phenomenon might explain the enhanced ramification of the interlimb vessels seen in the flox/flox mutants suggesting that vascular deletion of Bmpr1a might impair organogenesis of other tissues not investigated. In the rat aortic model of angiogenesis, MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression and activity did not only increase during the angiogenic growth phase of microvessels but also remained elevated and were necessary for microvessel regression (Zhu et al., 2000). Consistent with this, maximal MMP-2 activity is observed in the late corpus luteum concomitant with vessel regression (Duncan et al., 1998). The deletion of Bmpr1a in brain cells (Hebert et al., 2002) did not recapitulate the phenotype, further indicating the importance of the vasculature in this cell autonomous mechanism.The discrepancy between the phenotypes resulting from loss of Bmpr1a in VSMC and pericytes might be related to the fact that they have different basement membrane (Meyrick and Reid, 1979) and hence, could exhibit different effects resulting from reduced MMPs.It is worth mentioning that our findings did not recapitulate any aspects of juvenile polyposis where mutations in Bmpr1a have been identified for the fact that the formation of villus, areas of abnormal phenotype in this pathology, occurs after E15.5 (Batts et al., 2006)beyond the age of lethality of flox/flox mutants.
Clinical significanceOur study is the first to show that both MMP-9 and MMP-2 are developmentally regulated by expression of Bmpr1a and that attenuation in their levels could reduce proliferation of SMC leading to aneurysmal dilatation of large vessels. These observations could also explain the reduced cell proliferation leading to thinning of the ventricular wall. Our findings linking repression of Bmpr1a mediated MMP-2 activity to reduced apoptosis of pericytes, points to a feature important not only developmentally in clearing of microvessels, but potentially to a mechanism that might help in preserving or regenerating microvessels in disease. In our recent studies (El-Bizri et al., 2008) where patchy deletion of Bmpr1a was induced in VSMC, mice were actually protected against both the excessive muscularization and loss of distal vessels associated with chronic hypoxia induced PAH
