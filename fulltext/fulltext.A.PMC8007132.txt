Introduction
FGF-23 is a bone-derived signaling biomolecule that activates a FGFR/α-Klotho binary complex in the kidney to regulate renal metabolism of phosphate and vitamin-D.1 Excess FGF-23 results in rare hereditary hypophosphatemic disorders, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia2 (XLH), the autosomal recessive hypophoshatemic (ARH) bone-softening disorder ricketts,3 and acquired tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO).4 Adaptive increases in FGF-23 also maintain phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality.5 Recently, antagonizing FGF-23 with a blocking antibody has been successful in treating hypophosphatemic disorders caused by excess FGF-23. In this regard, a FGF-23 monoclonal antibody KRN23 (Crysvita®, burosumab) has been approved for treatment of XLH.6 There is an unmet clinical therapeutic need for an efficacious small molecule antagonist of FGF-23 that is selective, reversible, and non-biologic in nature as over suppression of FGF-23 has potential toxicities, including hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcifications. Because of the disadvantages associated with parenteral administration of biologics, developing an orally available small molecule drug to block the FGF-23 signaling sequence would have several potential advantages, including ease of administration, shorter half-life, effective dose-titration to more precisely inhibit FGF-23, and possibly result in greater efficacy and safety.
Virtual high-throughput screening (vHTs) via supercomputing utilizing structure-based molecular dynamics simulations7 employing ensemble docking strategies8 afforded ZINC13407541 (parent molecule, named as 1) as an in silico hit for selective FGF-23 antagonism (Fig. 1). Cellular assays validated 1 as a selective inhibitor of the FGF-23 signaling sequence in an in vitro heterologous cell expression model, as well as isolated renal tubules ex vivo.9 Preliminary animal model studies with a murine species that overexpressed FGF-23 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition, as well as partial reversal of hypophoshatemic effects. With in vitro and preliminary animal model efficacy of 1 confirmed, medicinal chemistry efforts transitioned to synthetic route optimization and elaboration towards formulating a lead compound from the original hit while further refining the original scaffold for greater efficacy and ease of synthetic preparation. Dissemination of the synthetic route to the prepared antagonist analogues, definition of the pharmacophore, probing of structure–activity relationships via synthetic analogues, and the optimization of in vitro potency of prepared molecules are reported.

Results
2.1.SynthesisThe synthetic construction of analogues as novel FGF-23 antagonists discovered from vHTS affording 1 was anchored from a common scaffold derived in several synthetic steps from readily available cycloalkanone starting materials (Scheme 1). Retrosynthetic analysis of 1 using standard functional group interconversions of oxime formation10 and metal-mediated transformations through the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling11 via known chemistry was envisioned.12 The convergency of the route allowed maximum flexibility of functionality towards pharmacophore mapping and optimization towards lead identification. Analogues were proposed to initially focus on variation of functionality to maintain conjugation of the extended π-system through the carbonyl and cycloalkene. Evaluation of ring size through the 5- and 6-membered common rings, in addition to heteroarene constructs was also performed (Scheme 2).arene and heteroarene constructs were evaluated. Extension of this strategy towards aryl and Conversion of cyclopentanone to 2-bromocyclopentene carbaldehyde using a modified Vilsmeier13 protocol adapted from Lipton14 afforded the desired synthon for metal-mediated coupling (4) in 70% yield. This reaction was amenable towards the formation of the 5-membered bromo-cyclopentene carbaldehyde 4 or the 6-membered homologue 5.15 Moving forward, treatment of 4 or 5 with potassium styrenyltrifluoroborate16 using Pd-catalysis via Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling17 conditions optimized in our laboratory18 resulted in the production of the necessary advanced aldehyde intermediates 6 and 7 for subsequent functional group interconversion.19 Conversion to the oxime 1 was successful under standard conditions resulting in a 46% yield over three steps from cyclopentanone (2) on micro scale. During route scouting and validation it was observed that 4 could be directly converted into the oxime 10 in high purity.20 Intermediate 10 was evaluated in parallel Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions towards the production of the functionalized oxime with potassium styrenyltrifluoroborate, but did not afford the desired product in comparable yield, or purity. The chemistry described in Scheme 1 was the basis for the production of all requisite functionalized aldehydes, including the pyridine, benzene, and thiophene oxime analogues of 1 (Scheme 2) 21With an established protocol to install the requisite carbon functionality onto the desired scaffolds, focus turned towards the completion of the oxime derivatives described in Table 1 for the definition of the pharmacophore and evaluation of structure-activity relationships probed by synthetic analogues. The original vHTS hit was divided into three zones for functional group manipulation towards understanding the impacts of various structural features of a given antagonist analogue on in vitro efficacy (Fig. 1). Zone 1 analogues evaluated the significance of the hydrogen bond donor oxime and related methyl oxime derivative. Zone 2 analogues studied the impact of saturated ring size through the common 5- and 6-membered cycloalkanes, in addition to substitution of phenyl, pyridinyl, and thiophene cores. Whereas, Zone 3 analogues of 1 probed the necessity of extended π-conjugation through the styrenyl, or direct connect aryl derivatives. The initial optimization analogue scope of 1 encompassed diverse functionality including conjugated styrenyl derivatives with aldehydes 4, 5, 11, 12, and 15. Aliphatic analogues (8f, 8g, and 8t) were critical for evaluating the importance of conjugation to maintenance of more potent biological activity. A vinyl derivative lacking any aryl ring (8u), as well as direct connect aryl moieties (8l-8s) were prepared. Aryl moieties with broad substitution patterns (o, m, p, or poly-) were explored while concomitantly ascertaining the significance of resonance- and electron-donating, in addition to electron-withdrawing functionality. Most oxime end products were afforded as one major stereoisomer in above 75% average isolated, purified yield. Structural confirmation of prepared analogues was facilitated via 1H- and 13C NMR in concert with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The unoptimized current synthetic route is reproducibly robust and can support future assay studies without extensive reoptimization.22 With the realization of a viable synthetic strategy to produce relevant analogues of 1 for structure-activity studies, the focus of the research shifted to evaluating the in vitro efficacy of the prepared analogues.
2.2.In vitro efficacyTo evaluate the potency of the newly synthesized compounds, in vitro efficacy of the prepared antagonists, as measured by percent inhibition using HEK-293 T cells expressing FGFRs/α-Klotho and FGF-23-induced ERK reporter activation as the read out, were performed (Fig. 2). Five distinct groups at 10 μM concentration were identified: Group I = 100% inhibition, Group II = 70–90% inhibition, Group III = 50–70% inhibition, Group IV = 20–50% inhibition, and Group V < 20% inhibition. Further structure / activity analysis revealed that the aldehyde precursor to 123 (6a) demonstrated 6-fold lower biological activity (%Max inhibition 46%) than 1 which underscores the significance of the oxime moiety to the pharmacophore of 1 in Group IV. The potential for hydrogen bonding of the oxime versus the methyl oxime 8e which, displayed <20% inhibition, signifies the importance of this functional group to the antagonist pharmacophore. Removal of aromatic functionality (8h, 8i, or 8t), or manipulation of the conjugation in 1 with analogues 8f and 8g proved deleterious to biological activity.Assessment of substitution of weakly donating alkyl substitutents on the aryl ring of 8a of core 4, as well as the resonance-donating methoxy-substituent of 8b highlighted the significance of these structural amendments to overall potency. Interestingly, manipulation of the cores from 4 to 5, 11, or 12, while retaining the 4-methylstyrenyl substituent (9b, 13a, or 14b) as part of the Zone 2 analogues, afforded the most potent analogues to 1, while demonstrating the relevance of this substituted to biological activity. Electrocyclization analogue 8v, afforded during chromatography of 1, and postulated to potentially be an in vivo metabolite of 1, produced poor activity results as a constituent of Group V did not validate the aforementioned hypothesis.24 Subsequent effort targeted the preparation of analogues which were devoid of the transalkenyl double bond which bridged the core to the aryl substituents. Excision of the interstitial trans-double bond alleviates two rotatable bonds,25 modulates lipophilicity slightly, and affords more rapid access to future functionally group diverse examples vide infra. Compounds 8m and 8o, direct-connect, aromatic derivatives of 8a and 8b, which negated the vinyl group, demonstrated lower than half biological activity compared to 1 and further validated the relevance of extension of conjugation, or electron density, as potential influences on increased activity. Thiophene analogues of 1 were extremely challenging to synthesize and purify. Substantive efforts afforded 16a and 16b which performed inferiorly to 1. Probing the structural nature of the oxime with respect to biological activity as part of the Zone 3 analogues, including the methyl oxime 8a, aldoxime 1 afforded slightly higher potency. Based on the initial in vitro results presented, eight analogues were selected from Groups I to IV for IC50 determinations (Table 2).The IC50 values of prepared FGF-23 antagonist analogues evaluated ranged from 0.14 μM (13a) to 31 μM (6a) with a ranked order of 13a (0.14 μM), 8a (0.20 μM), 8c (0.37 μM), 14b (0.39 μM), 9b (0.52 μM), 8n (2.79 μM), 8 l (10 μM), 8o (12.3 μM) and 6a (31 μM), respectively. 8n, 8 l, and 8o decreased maximum inhibition activity (%Max inhibition 60 ~ 70%) in Group II, III, and IV. On the aryl ring of 8a and 8c, a 4-position electron-donating substituent CH3 for 8a and the resonance-donating substituent OCH3 for 8c largely increases the efficacy, leading to 10 ~ 25-fold higher potency for inhibiting FGF-23 activity when compared to 1 (IC50 5.0 μM) in Group I. The presence of the double bond in 8c compared to 8o resulted in an order of magnitude increase in activity for the former, as compared to the latter. In addition, incorporation of a 6-membered cyclohexenyl ring (9b), aromatic ring (13a) or heteroaromatic core (14b) on these analogues resulted in 10 ~ 36-fold higher potency for inhibiting FGF-23 activity as opposed to 1 (IC50 5.0 μM) in Group I. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that all the test compounds have no obvious cytotoxicity from 10−9 M to 10−5 M, which is further underscored by the fact that IC50 values were dramatically lower than EC50 values. Only 8n showed markedly stimulated cellular LDH release at a concentration of 10−4 M with 2.30 × 102 μM EC50. The EC50 values of other compounds with a ranked order are 8a (5.70 × 102 μM), 13a (6.90 × 102 μM), 1 (1.41 × 103 μM), 80 (1.91 × 103 μM), and 14b (2.41 × 103 μM), respectively. Future studies will examine the adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, selectivity and toxicity of these lead compounds.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have described an efficiently convergent and diversified approach to small-molecule antagonists of the bone-derived signaling biomolecule FGF-23 from an initial vHTS hit. Structure-activity relationships were probed from the preparation of expansive synthetic analogues which have preliminary defined the requisite pharmacophore of this antagonist class requiring a polar oxime with a conjugated aryl group with electron-donating substituents being able to achieve sub 1 μM inhibition in the FGF-23 signaling sequence from in vitro, cellular IC50 assays. Subsequent lead optimization efforts with respect to first pass metabolic stability, oral availability, toxicity, and animal model studies are ongoing in these laboratories and will be reported in due course.

4.1.Minimum inhibitory concentration assays4.1.1.Cell culture and in vitro functional assaysHEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). To test the effects of the novel compounds on FGF-23-mediated activation of FGFR1/α-KL complex, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either empty expression vector or full-length human α-KL along with the ERK luciferase reporter system12 and Renilla luciferase-null as internal control plasmid. Transfections were performed by electroporation using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit® according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Thirty-six hours after transfection, the transfected cells were treated with each of the newly synthesized compound (10−5 M) or selected compound with a range of 10−9 ~ 10−4 M in the presence or absence of 1 nM FGF23 for IC50. After 5 h, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities measured using a Synergy® H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Winooski, VT, USA) and Promega® Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Madison, WI, USA). The IC50 values of the test compounds were obtained graphically from concentration-effect curves using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc).4.1.2.Cytotoxicity assaysHEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). To test cytotoxicity of the selected compounds, HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 104/well. The compound toxicity was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity released in the media 5 h after the test compound or vehicle exposure using the CytoTox96 nonradioactive assay (Promega) and quantitated by measuring wavelength absorbance at 490 nm. The LDH released from the cells exposed to different concentrations (10−6 ~ 10−3 M) of the compound were normalized to the amount of LDH released from vehicle-treated cells receiving 10 μL of 10 × Lysis Solution (100%, maximum LDH release) and were corrected for baseline LDH released from vehicle-treated cells. The EC50 values of the test compounds were obtained graphically from concentration-effect curves using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc).
4.2.Statistical analysisWe evaluated differences between two groups by unpaired t-test. All values are expressed as means ± S.D. All computations were performed using a commercial biostatistics software (GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA).
