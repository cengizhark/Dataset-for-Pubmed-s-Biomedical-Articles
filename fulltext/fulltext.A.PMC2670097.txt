Introduction
Breast cancer has been one of the leading causes of death in American females for many years. Although multiple combined modality treatment strategies are available and continue to be improved, seeking for alternative therapeutics with a better therapeutic index remains a top priority of the drug development endeavors. Many of the established cancer therapeutics, represented by the microtubule poison taxane and Vinca alkaloids, inhibit cancer cell growth via direct inhibition of mitosis 1, 2. Mitosis is a highly dynamic and delicate process that requires multiple layers of regulation by a variety of molecules. Several innovative agents targeting the key mitotic regulators are currently in preclinical or clinical development, including those inhibiting the spindle-associated kinesin KSP/Eg5, kinetochore-associated kinesin CENP-E, and the mitotic kinase Aurora 3, 4. However, whether the downstream substrate of mitotic kinases may serve as a potential target remains to be explored.
One of the critical mitotic regulators is Hec1a, an oncogene that modulates proper spindle formation between kinetochores and centrosomes. Importantly, overexpression of Hec1 has been documented to associate with poor clinical outcomes of primary breast cancers as well as cases with multiple cancers 5, 6. Inducible overexpression of Hec1 in a transgenic mouse model led to evident tumor formation, primarily lung adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma 7. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Hec1 by Nek2 is known to be critical for its mitotic function and cell survival 8, 9. We have recently identified small molecules INH1 and INH2 that can effectively suppress tumor cell growth in culture and in animals via directly targeting the Hec1/Nek2 mitotic pathway 10. Our leads, INH1 and INH2, sharing an aryl thiazolyl benzamide scaffold, came from screening a library of ∼24,000 synthetic compounds through an inducible reverse yeast two-hybrid system. Although both of them inhibit the proliferation of multiple human breast cancer cell lines in culture, the potency in killing cancer cells and the water solubility remain to be improved for better efficacy. As part of a broad chemical strategy aimed toward the discovery of novel INH analogues, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of novel INH analogues. SAR (Structure-activity Relationship) of INH scaffold was also illustrated. INH1 and INH2 both have a core phenyl-thiazolyl-benzamide structures with additional groups on both sides of the thiazolyl rings (Figure 1). The main scaffold of INH was composed of three parts: left part (hydrophobic aryl ring), middle part (thiazolyl ring) and right part (arylamide polar part). The modification of INH analogues was mainly focused on these three parts.
Results and Discussion
ChemistryOur synthesis embarked on the preparation of two intermediates 3 and 4 followed by the general synthetic procedure shown in Scheme 1. That is, treatment of bromides 1 and 2 with thiourea in refluxing EtOH afforded 4-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)thiazol-2-ylamine (3) and 4-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)thiazol-2-ylamine (4) in 89% and 99% yields, respectively. Acylation of amines 3 and 4 with a series of aryl acyl chloride provided the corresponding INH analogues 5-19 in medium to good yields. In addition, treatment of amines 3 and 4 with 4-morpholinecarbonyl chloride led to the compounds 20 and 21 in 63% and 39% yields, respectively. Sulphonylation of 3 with benzenesulfonyl chloride and benzylsulfonyl chloride furnished the compounds 22 and 23 in 68% and 63% yields, respectively.To explore the influence of the hydrogen atom of amide groups on bioactivities, methylated INH analogues 24-26 were prepared (Scheme 2). Treatment of INH1 and compound 6 with NaH / MeI / THF gave the methylated compounds 24 and 25 as the only product in 74% and 89% yields, respectively. Interestingly, subjecting INH2 to the same condition (NaH / MeI / THF) gave two separable methylated compounds 26 and 27 in 26% and 63% yields, respectively. In our opinion, the generation of compound 27 was ascribed to the electron-donating properties of two MeO groups. That is, once INH2 was treated with NaH in THF, the two MeO groups would result in the formation of two intermediates 28 and 29 in tautomeric equilibrium. Intermediate 29 was thought to be preferable to the intermediate 28 because the electronegative center in 29 was more remote from the two electron donating MeO groups than that in the intermediate 28, which was consistent with the higher yield of product 27. Furthermore, a steric contribution to the observed selectivity (higher yield of 27) should also be taken into account as the ortho methoxy group would be occupying the same place as the methyl added to the amide nitrogen. Additionally, amide-protected compound 30 was prepared in 72% yield via treatment of compound 6 with NaH / BrCH2CO2Et / THF. Saponification of the ester 30 with LiOH afforded the acid 31 in 77% yield.Some phenolic group-containing derivatives were also prepared (Scheme 3). Treatment of INH2 with BBr3 (1.5 eq.) in CH2Cl2 for 2 h smoothly gave the phenol 32 in 72% yield along with diphenol 33 in 3% yield. Further, subjecting INH2 to BBr3 (6.5 eq.) in CH2Cl2 for 3 hr delivered 32 in 20% yield and the diphenol 33 in 64% yield. Synthesis of compound 36 started from 2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethylacetophenone (34), which was converted to the 2-aminothiazoline 35 in three steps including methylation with Me2SO4 / K2CO3, bromination with HBr / BuOOH and final condensation of the resultant α-bromoacetone with thiourea. Benzoylation of amine 35 smoothly gave the compound 36 in 93% yield. Exposure of compound 36 to BBr3 / CH2Cl2 at room temperature provided the phenol analogue 37 in 90% yield.Substitution of an oxazolyl ring for the thiazolinyl ring in INH1 was also accomplished (Scheme 4). Reaction of bromide 1 with urea in refluxing EtOH gave the corresponding 2-aminooxazole 38, which was benzoylated to afford the 2-aminooxazolyl derivative 39. In addition, replacement of amide group in INH1 with thioamide group was performed through treatment with INH1 with Lawesson′s reagent in refluxing toluene and the desired thioamide derivative 40 was obtained in 79% yield.
SAR analysis of the INH analoguesSynthesized analogues 3-27, 30-33, 36-37 and 39-40 were tested for their killing activities on human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468, human cervical cancer line HeLa and human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line K562. The results are outlined in Table 1, which are the basis of the current SAR analysis. Upon removal of the benzoyl groups from INH1 and INH2, the resultant thiazolyl amine 3 and 4 did not exhibit any anti-proliferative activity even at > 40 μM, indicating that benzoyl moiety is indispensable. Remarkably, the hybrid compound 5 containing the left moiety of INH1 and the right moiety of INH2 exhibited very low anti-proliferation activities against all the tested cell lines. To our delight, the other hybrid compound 6, containing the right moiety of INH2 and the left moiety of INH1, exhibited significantly improved anti-proliferation activities compared with our leads INH1 and 2. Additionally, deletion of the para-methoxyl group in INH2 resulted in the dramatic loss of bioactivity (7) and replacement of the methoxyl group in 7 with trifluoromethyl group would efficiently improve the bioactivity by approximately 1.5-2 fold (8). Based on the above results and in light of the well-known strong electron-withdrawing properties of trifluoromethyl group that renders neighboring group polar, we proposed that 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl is preferred to 2,4-dimethyl phenyl, probably due to less rotational flexibility, and that introduction of a more polar group on the right moiety of scaffold seems to improve the bioactivity.A series of analogues 9-21 containing different polar groups on the right part of scaffold was prepared and the biological activities were evaluated. As expected, most analogues exhibited better cell killing activity than the original leads. For most cases, 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl group was more active than 2,4-dimethyl phenyl group. Apparently, isonicotinoyl group (13) was preferred to pyridine-2-carboxyl group (9, 10) and nicotinoyl group (11, 12). Substitution of pyrazinyl group for isonicotinoyl group led to a considerable reduction in bioactivity (13vs14) although compound 15 still exhibited good bioactivity. The bioactivity variation between 16 and 17, which contain 1-methyl-1H-imidazolyl groups, further consolidated our conclusion that 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl group was preferred to 2,4-dimethyl phenyl group. Introduction of 1,3-thiazolyl groups did not change the bioactivities significantly (18, 19). Notably, the replacement of phenyl group in lead INH1 with morpholinyl group efficiently improved the activity. Among the analogues made, 6, 13 and 21 displayed the strongest activity, the IC50 values of which were improved by 6-8 fold in comparison to INH1. The para position of the hetero atom (N, O) on the six-membered ring of compounds 13 and 21 clearly provides advantages over the lead INH1 and the pyridine-2-carboxyl derivatives 9-10 (with hetero atom N at ortho-position), suggesting possible existence of an extended hydrophilic groove or pocket in the target binding site.Replacement of amide moiety in INH1 with sulfonyl amide reduced the activity significantly (22-23, IC50 > 40 μM). Upon methylation of amide groups of INH1 or 2 and compound 6, the resultant derivatives 24-26 showed weakened bioactivities against all the tested cell lines, indicating that methylation of the amide group negatively affects compound activity. Although compound 30 derived from ethoxycarbonylmethylating compound 6 still displayed weak activities, its saponified product 31 is almost inactive (IC50 > 40 μM). Demethylated derivative 33 of INH2 showed very weak activity, but monophenol compound 32 still exhibited slightly weak bioactivity compared with INH2, which indicated that phenol group on the para-position was not preferred. Interestingly, compounds 36-37, derived from substitution of methoxyl group and hydroxyl group for C6 methyl group in 6, were also found to be active although bioactivity decreased significantly. Additionally, we also found that conversion of thiazolyl ring in INH1 to oxazolyl ring (39) or transformation of amide group in INH1 to thioamide group (40) also made the bioactivity decrease, which demonstrated that thiazolyl ring and amide group were important for the cytotoxicity.
Target validation of INH analoguesNext, target validation was performed by using an affinity pulldown assay described previously 10. Because compounds 6, 13 and 21 showed most improved cell killing activities with similar IC50 values in the SAR analysis, they were chosen for target validation by using compound 22 as a negative control. More specifically, 6 was used as a positive compound and 22 as a negative control in the affinity pulldown assay. In principle, compounds 6 and 22 were individually conjugated to an affi-gel matrix through a multistep synthetic route (Supplemental information) (Figure 2A) 10. HeLa cell extract was prepared and subjected to affinity pulldown experiments with control or compound-conjugated matrices. Shown in Figure 2B, 6-conjugated matrix, but not 22-conjugated or unconjugated matrix, selectively co-precipitated with cellular Hec1. In contrast, none of them co-precipitated with cellular Nek2. The results suggest that compound 6 binds to cellular Hec1, similar to the lead, INH1.A hallmark mechanism of action by INH1 is to trigger dramatic reduction of Nek2 protein level 10. To determine whether INH analogues retain such bioactivity in cells, both time and dosage-dependent kinetic studies were carried out in HeLa cells. The protein levels of Hec1 and Nek2 were examined by Western blot. In a doses-dependent study, Nek2 was found to be undetectable on treating cells with INH1 (25 μM), or lower dosages of 6 or 21 (both at 6.25 μM), but not by the negative compound 22 (up to 25 μM) (Figure 2C). For the time-dependent study, cells were treated with 6.25 μM of compound 6 or 21. Notably, the Nek2 level was reduced by ∼50% at 8-11 h after treatment with 6 or 21, which was comparable to INH1 treatment at 25 μM with a similar period of time (Figure 2D). In contrast, 22 showed no effect on Nek2 level at any time point tested. In addition, 6 and 21 seemed to trigger a slight Hec1 decrease over time, unlike the treatment with INH1, though the significance of partial Hec1 reduction is not clear at present. These results indicate that 6 and 21 are more efficient in targeting the Hec1/Nek2 complex for degradation.
Compound 6 and 21 triggered mitotic abnormalitiesThe Hec1/Nek2 complex functions primarily during G2 and M phases. Perturbation of the Hec1 or Nek2 function by antagonists (RNAi or antibody) leads to mitotic abnormalities represented by spindle configuration changes and chromosome misalignment, which contribute to mitotic catastrophe 11-18. Treating cells with INH1 similarly led to mitotic abnormalities, albeit to a lesser extent 10. To test whether compound 6 and 21 can elicit similar mitotic phenotypes via inhibiting Hec1/Nek2, cells were treated with 6, 21 or the negative compound 22. In comparison to the mock or 22-treated cells, 6 or 21 treated cells exhibited increased mitotic population with multipolar spindle configurations, presumably because of defective Hec1/Nek2 functionality (Figure 3A). Consistently, an increased rate of chromosome misalignment was detected upon treatment with 6 or 21 of HeLa cells expressing the chromosome marker protein H2B-GFP (Figure 3B). At the dosage of 6.25 μM, 6 and 21 elicited mitotic abnormalities to a similar extent as INH1 treatment at 25 μM, further confirming the improved efficacy of compound 6 and 21.
Treatment of cells with compound 6 and 21 induced apoptosisMitotic abnormalities often lead to mitotic arrest, often followed by mitotic slippage and consequent mitotic catastrophe (i.e., cell death due to abnormal mitosis). Lead compound INH1 is known to trigger mitotic catastrophe. To examine whether compound 6 and 21 may trigger mitotic catastrophe, a time lapse experiment was performed to monitor the cell morphological changes and potential apoptosis. As expected, 6 or 21 treated cells showed progressive morphological changes characteristic of dying cells (e.g., membrane bubbling), which is further confirmed by cell cycle profiling with FACS analysis (Figure 4A and 4B). For instance, approximately 20% of compound 6 or 22 treated cells were apoptotic 72 hrs after treatment. The above results are consistent with the mitosis-targeting activity of compound 6 and 21 with improved efficacy.
Conclusion
This study has identified several INH analogues that show a 6-8 folds increase in cellular killing activity by targeting Hec1/Nek2 pathway. The SAR study identified a few key structural features that may serve as a guideline for further improvement of the current compounds using medicinal chemical approaches. In essence, the presence of a hydrophobic ring with less rotational freedom, such as 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl, is preferred at the left part of the scaffold (Figure 1). Introducing hetero atoms (N, O) or a polar group to the para positions of the six-membered ring on the right side of the scaffold seems to dramatically improve both solubility and bioactivity. Finally, the integrity of the thiazolyl ring and the amide bond in the middle of the scaffold is important for maintaining compound activity.
Two of the improved versions, compound 6 and 21, are capable of targeting the cellular Hec1/Nek2 complex, triggering mitotic abnormalities and cell death at a much lower dosage than the lead INH1. The structural features identified in this study may serve as a foundation for designing, synthesis and evaluation of the next generation of INH derivatives with further refinement for potential clinical applications.
